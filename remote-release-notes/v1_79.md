## Core

All remotes now provide a choice of where to open a remote from the Remote Explorer: either in the current window or a new window. These are available in both the inline or context menu.

In the video below, both the [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels) and [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) views in the Remote Explorer display the **Connect in Current Window** and **Connect in New Window** commands.
