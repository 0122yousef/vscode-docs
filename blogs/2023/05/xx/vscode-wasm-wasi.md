# Using WebAssemblies to execute non JavaScript code in VS Code Web

[VS Code for the Web](https://vscode.dev/) has been around for a while now and it has always been our goal to support the edit / compile / debug cycle for languages different than JavaScript and TypeScript. In doing so we must be able to execute (and therefore debug) the code. For example, to run Python code in a browser we need an execution engine that allows us to run the [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter. These language runtimes are usually written in C/C++. [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) technology can be used to execute code other than JavaScript in a web browser. We have decided to explore how far we can get using WebAssemblies today to get Python code executed in a browser. Luckily, the Python team already started working on compiling [CPython to WASM](https://github.com/brettcannon/cpython-wasi-build/releases) and we happily piggybacked on their effort. The outcome of the exploration can be seen in the screen cast below:

It doesn't really look different to executing Python code in VS Code desktop. So, why is this cool?

- the Python code (`app.py` and `hello.py`) is actually hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dbaeumer/wasm-wasi-sample) and directly read from GitHub. So the Python interpreter has full access to the files in the workspace.
- the sample code is multi file. `app.py` depends on `hello.py`.
- the output shows up nicely in VS Code's terminal.
- you can run a Python REPL and fully interact with it.
- and of course it RUNS in the web.

Additionally, the Python interpreter compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) code has no modification to be run in VS Code for the web. The bits are one for one the once created by the CPython team.

## How does it work?

How does the WebAssembly code talk to the files in the workspace and gets access to VS Code's terminal? The Python team provides WebAssembly binaries of their interpreter in two flavors: one compiled with [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html) and the other compiled with the [WASI-SDK](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk). Although they both create WebAssembly code they have quite different characteristics:

- *emscripten*: has a special focus on the Web platform and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). In addition to generating WASM code it also generates JavaScript code that acts as a host to execute the WASM code in either the browser or Node.js environment.
- *WASI-SDK*: compiles C/C++ code to WASM and assumes a host implementation that conforms to the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) [specification](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI). WASI stands for WebAssembly System Interface. It defines several operating-system-like features, including files and file systems, sockets, clocks, and random numbers. [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) is for example a runtime that provides a WASI host implementation and therefore supports executing WebAssembly code compiled to WASM-WASI on a standard operation system.

For VS Code we decided to support WASI. Although our primary focus is to execute WASM code in the browser, we are not actually running it in a pure browser environment. We have to run WebAssemblies in VS Code's extension host worker since this is the standard way how VS Code is extended. The extension host worker provides, beside the browser's worker API, the whole [VS Code Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api). So instead of wiring a `read` call in a C/C++ program to the browser's fetch API we actually want to wire it to VS Code's [file system](https://insiders.vscode.dev/github/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L8378) API. Doing this in WASI was easier for us than in emscripten.

Our current implementation of VS Code's WASI host is based on the [WASI snapshot preview1](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/preview1/docs.md). So all implementation details described in this blog post refer to that version.

## How can I try it?

Before digging deeper into technical details, the blog post outlines how to compile your own little C program to `wasm32-wasi` and execute it inside VS Code's extension host. The example assumes that the reader is familiar with [VS Code's Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) and knows how to write an extension for [VS Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions).

The C program we run is a simple "Hello World" program that looks like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Assuming you have the latest WASI-SDK installed and it is on your PATH the C program can be compile using the following command:

```sh
clang hello.c -o ./hello.wasm
```

This will generated a `hello.wasm` file next to the `hello.c` file.

New features are added to VS Code via extensions, and we follow the same model when integrating WebAssemblies into VS Code. We need to define an extension that loads and runs the WASM code. The important parts of the extension's `package.json` manifest are as follows:

```json
{
    "name": "...",
    ...,
	"extensionDependencies": [
		"ms-vscode.wasm-wasi-core"
	],
	"contributes": {
		"commands": [
			{
				"command": "wasm-c-example.run",
				"category": "WASM Example",
				"title": "Run C Hello World"
			}
		]
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"@types/vscode": "1.77.0",
	},
	"dependencies": {
		"@vscode/wasm-wasi": "0.11.0-next.0"
	}
}
```

The [`ms-vscode.wasm-wasi-core`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.wasm-wasi-core) extension supplies the WebAssembly execution engine which wires the WASI API up to the VS Code API. The node module `@vscode/wasm-wasi` provides a facade to ease calling that API.

Below is the actual TypeScript code to load and run WebAssembly code:

```typescript
import { Wasm } from '@vscode/wasm-wasi';
import { commands, ExtensionContext, Uri, window, workspace } from 'vscode';

export async function activate(context: ExtensionContext) {

	// Load the WASM API
	const wasm: Wasm = await Wasm.load();

	// Register a command that runs the C example
	commands.registerCommand('wasm-wasi-c-example.run', async () => {
		// Create a pseudoterminal to provide stdio to the WASM process.
		const pty = wasm.createPseudoterminal();
		const terminal = window.createTerminal({ name: 'Run C Example', pty, isTransient: true });
		terminal.show(true);

		try {
			// Load the WASM module. It is stored alongside the extension's JS code.
			// So we can use VS Code's file system API to load it. Makes it
			// independent of whether the code runs in the desktop or the web.
			const bits = await workspace.fs.readFile(Uri.joinPath(context.extensionUri, 'hello.wasm'));
			const module = await WebAssembly.compile(bits);
			// Create a WASM process.
			const process = await wasm.createProcess('hello', module, { stdio: pty.stdio });
			// Run the process and wait for its result.
			const result = await process.run();
		} catch (error) {
			// Show an error message if something goes wrong.
			await window.showErrorMessage(error.message);
		}
	});
}
```

The screen cast below shows the extension running in VS Code for the Web.

We used C/C++ code as a source for our WebAssembly. Because WASI is a standard there are other toolchains that support the `wasm-wasi` target. Examples are: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-wasi-sdk) or [Swift](https://swiftwasm.org/)

## VS Code's WASI Implementation

WASI is a specification and basing our WebAssembly support on it requires that VS Code implements that specification. This sounds simple, but there is a big difference between WASI and VS Code's API: WebAssembly code execution is sync (e.g. once a WebAssembly execution started, the JavaScript worker is blocked until the execution finished) whereas most of VS Code's API (especially around file access) is async. This characteristic causes two problems for the execution of WebAssembly code inside VS Code extension host worker:

- we need to prevent the extension host from being blocked while executing WebAssembly code since this would block other extensions from being executed.
- VS Code API is mostly async. A mechanism is needed to map the sync behavior of WebAssemblies / WASI onto the async VS Code API.

The first case is easy to solve: we simply run the WebAssembly code in a separate worker thread. The second case is harder to solve since mapping sync code onto async code needs suspending the sync executing thread and resuming it when the asynchronously computed result is available. The [JavaScript-Promise Integration Proposal for WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-promise-integration) solves this problem on the WASM layer and there is an experimental implementation of the proposal in [V8](https://v8.dev/blog/jspi). However, when we started the effort the V8 implementation was not available yet. So we choose a different implementation, which uses [`SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) and [`Atomics`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics) to map the sync WASI API onto VS Code's async API. The approach works as follows:

- the WASM worker thread creates a `SharedArrayBuffer` with the necessary information about the code that should be called on the VS Code side.
- it posts the shared memory to VS Code's extension host worker and then waits for the extension host worker to finish its work using [`Atomics.wait`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics/wait)
- the extension host worker takes the message, calls the appropriate VS Code API, writes results back into the `SharedArrayBuffer` and then notifies the WASM worker thread to wake up using [`Atomics.store`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics/store) and [`Atomics.notify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics/notify).
- the WASM worker then reads any result data out of the `SharedArrayBuffer` and returns it to the WASI callback.

The only difficulty with this approach is that `SharedArrayBuffer` and `Atomics` require the site to be [cross-origin isolated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements), which, due to the fact that CORS is very viral, can be an endeavour by itself. This is why it is currently only enabled by default on https://insiders.vscode.dev/ and must be enabled using the query parameter `?vscode-coi=` on https://vscode.dev/

Below is a diagram showing the interaction between the WASM worker and the extension host worker in more detail for the little C program from above that we compiled to WebAssembly. The code in the orange box is WebAssembly code and all the code in green boxes runs in JavaScript. The yellow box represents the `SharedArrayBuffer`

## A Web Shell

Now that we were able to compile C/C++ and Rust code to WebAssembly and execute it in VS Code, we explored whether we can run a shell in VS Code for the Web as well.

We investigated into compiling one of the *nix shells to WebAssembly. However, shells rely on OS features (spawning processes, ...) not available in WASI right now. We took a slightly different approach: we implemented a basic shell in TypeScript and tried to compile only the *nix core utils like ls, cat, date, ... to WebAssembly. Since Rust has very good support for WASM and WASI we gave the [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) a cross-platform re-implementation of the GNU coreutils in Rust a try. Et voilÃ , we had a first minimal web shell.

![A web shell](./webshell.gif)

A shell is very limited if you can't execute custom WebAssemblies or commands. To extend the web shell extensions can contribute additional mount points to the file system as well as commands that are invoked when they are typed into the web shell. The indirection via commands decouples the concrete WebAssembly execution from what is type in the terminal. Using this support in the Python extension form the beginning allows two execute Python code directly from within the shell by entering `python app.py` into the prompt or listing the default python 3.11 library which is usually mounted under `/usr/local/lib/python3.11`

## What comes next

The WASM execution engine extension and the Web Shell extension are both experimental and in preview mode and shouldn't be used right now to implement production ready extensions using WebAssemblies. They have been made publicly available to get early feedback on the technology. If you have any questions or feedback please open issues in the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-wasm/issues).

What we do know is that we will extend exploration into the following topics:
- the WASI team is working on a preview2 of the specification, which we want to support as well. Version 2 will change the way a WASI host is implemented. However, we are confident that we can keep the API, which is exposed in the WASM execution engine extension, mostly stable.
- lots of language servers for VS Code are implemented in languages different than JavaScript or TypeScript. We plan to explore the possibility of compiling these language servers to `wasm-wasi` and run them in VS Code for the Web as well.
- improving debugging for Python on the Web. We have started to work this, so stay tuned.
- ensuring that other language runtimes that are compiled for `wasm-wasi` run on top of VS Code's WebAssembly execution engine. [VM Ware Labs](https://github.com/vmware-labs/webassembly-language-runtimes) for example provide Ruby and PHP `wasm-wasi` binaries. Both do run in VS Code.
