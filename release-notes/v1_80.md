## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_80.md).

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues.

Review the [changelog for the 0.67.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0670) release of the extension to learn about the other highlights.

## Preview Features

### TypeScript 5.2 support

This update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.2 release. Check out the [TypeScript 5.2 iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/54298) for more details about what the TypeScript team is currently working on. Upcoming tooling highlights include:

* A new **Inline constant** refactoring.
* A new **Move to file** refactoring that lets you move a symbol into an existing file.

To start using the TypeScript 5.2 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) extension.

## Extension authoring

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

## Engineering

### Name mangling of exported symbols

Last year we started [mangling the names of private properties and methods](v1_74.md#name-mangling-of-properties-and-method) to reduce our code size. We now also mangle exported symbol names, which reduces the size of our main workbench JavaScript file a further 8%.

Our name mangling build step mangling now saves a total of 3.9MB of JavaScript across core VS Code and our builtin extensions. This reduction speeds up downloads, reduces VS Code's install size, and speeds up code loading every time you start VS Code.

## Notable fixes

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
