# June 2023 (version 1.80)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.80 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/184844)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Accessibility

## Workbench

### Auto playing and looping for previewed videos

You can now enable video autoplaying and looping for the built-in video file preview. The relevant settings are:

* `mediaPreview.video.autoPlay` — Enable autoplaying of videos. Autoplayed videos are automatically muted.
* `mediaPreview.video.loop` — Enable looping of videos.

These settings are off by default.

### New setting to set a default file dialog location

A new setting `files.dialog.defaultPath` can be set to configure the default location that file dialogs (for example when opening or saving files or folders) should show when they open. This default will be used only as a fallback in contexts where no other location is known, for example in empty windows.

### New setting to disable maximizing editor groups on tab double click

A new setting `workbench.editor.doubleClickTabToToggleEditorGroupSizes` is introduced to disable toggling the size of an editor group from maximized to restored when double clicking on a tab of that group.

### New setting to control minimal width of fixed width tabs

A new setting `workbench.editor.tabSizingFixedMinWidth` allows to change the minimal size a tab should have when `workbench.editor.tabSizing` is set to `fixed`. Fixed tab widths are explained in more detail [here]([Title](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_79#_new-tab-sizing-option-fixed)).

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_80.md).

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues.

Review the [changelog for the 0.67.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0670) release of the extension to learn about the other highlights.

## Preview Features

### TypeScript 5.2 support

This update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.2 release. Check out the [TypeScript 5.2 iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/54298) for more details about what the TypeScript team is currently working on. Upcoming tooling highlights include:

* A new **Inline constant** refactoring.
* A new **Move to file** refactoring that lets you move a symbol into an existing file.

To start using the TypeScript 5.2 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) extension.

## Extension authoring

### Improved `vscode.fs.writeFile` performance for local files

When you are using `vscode.fs.writeFile` API to write data into files (you should!), write operations to files that are local to the extension host will now resolve much faster.

Previously the extension host would delegate the write operation to the VS Code client for execution, but now the operation executes directly inside the extension host, saving round trips.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

## Engineering

### Name mangling of exported symbols

Last year we started [mangling the names of private properties and methods](v1_74.md#name-mangling-of-properties-and-method) to reduce our code size. We now also mangle exported symbol names, which reduces the size of our main workbench JavaScript file a further 8%.

Our name mangling build step mangling now saves a total of 3.9MB of JavaScript across core VS Code and our builtin extensions. This reduction speeds up downloads, reduces VS Code's install size, and speeds up code loading every time you start VS Code.

### Checksum integrity checks for node.js, built-in extensions and Electron

As part of our build, we consume binary resources from other locations, such as node.js for our remote server, built-in extensions from the marketplace and Electron. In this milestone we added capabilities to ensure the integrity of these binary resources by validating against a SHA256 checksum that is checked into the `vscode` GitHub repository.

### New Linux performance machine

We take performance of VS Code very serious, especially the time it takes to open a text editor and see a blining cursor. For that purpose we run daily performance tests on Windows and macOS.

This milestone we added a Linux machine to the set, reporting the startup times on Ubuntu 22.
