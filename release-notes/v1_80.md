## Accessibility

### Accessibility help for notebooks

A new accessibility help menu was added for notebooks to provide information about the editor layout and navigating and interacting with the notebook.

## Workbench

### Auto playing and looping for previewed videos

You can now enable video autoplaying and looping for the built-in video file preview. The relevant settings are:

* `mediaPreview.video.autoPlay` — Enable autoplaying of videos. Autoplayed videos are automatically muted.
* `mediaPreview.video.loop` — Enable looping of videos.

These settings are off by default.

### More help when editor is readonly

With the introduction of [readonly mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_79#_readonly-mode) in VS Code last milestone, editors can appear readonly due to workspace configuration.

This milestone we enhanced the notification message in the editor when you try to type to account for why the editor is readonly and in some cases provide a link to change the settings.

<video src="images/1_80/editor-readonly.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Editor readonly message indicator"></video>

### Default file dialog location

A new setting `files.dialog.defaultPath` can be set to configure the default location that file dialogs (for example when opening or saving files or folders) should show when they open. This default will be used only as a fallback in contexts where no other location is known, for example in empty windows.

### Disable maximizing editor groups on tab double-click

A new setting `workbench.editor.doubleClickTabToToggleEditorGroupSizes` disables toggling the size of an editor group from maximized to restored when double-clicking on a tab of that group.

### Control minimal width of fixed width tabs

A new setting `workbench.editor.tabSizingFixedMinWidth` controls the minimum size of a tab when `workbench.editor.tabSizing` is set to `fixed`. Fixed tab widths are explained in more detail in the [1.79 release notes]((https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_79#_new-tab-sizing-option-fixed)).

### Editor group split sizing changed to 'auto'

A new value for the `workbench.editor.splitSizing` called `auto` is the new default: in this mode splitting an editor group will distribute the available size evenly to all editor groups only if none of the editor groups has been resized. Otherwise, the space of the editor group that is split will be taken in half and given to the new editor group.

<video src="images/1_80/auto-split-sizing.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Editor group auto split sizing"></video>

The intent of this change is to not break layouts that you have created when you split, but still preserve the previous default behavior of distributing the size otherwise.

### Search .gitignore exclude behavior

When `search.useIgnoreFiles` is set to `true`, the workspace's `.gitignore` is now respected regardless of whether the workspace is initialized as a Git repository or not.

### Settings editor alt text improvements

The Settings editor (accessible through the "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)" command) is now less verbose when navigating it with a screenreader. In particular, the Settings scope switcher announces the actual name of the scope rather than a file path, and the settings description alt text has been cleaned up to not include raw Markdown formatting.

![Navigating through the Settings editor with NVDA on Windows](images/1_80/se-screenreader.gif)

### Troubleshooting Issue in VS Code

A new command `Help: Troubleshoot Issue` is available in the Command Palette to help you troubleshoot an issue in VS Code. It is a process to help you identify the cause for an issue using Profiles and Extension Bisect features of VS Code. The cause for an issue can be a misconfiguration, due to an extension, or be VS Code itself. This will help you providing us with the right information while reporting an issue.

<video src="images/1_80/issue-troubleshoot.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Troubleshooting Issue Demo"></video>

### Max height for comments

The setting `comments.maxHeight` will let you disable the max height restriction on editor comments.

### Disable Chromium sandbox

If you are in an environment where launching the desktop application of VSCode as an elevated user is unavoidable (i-e) you are launching VSCode with `sudo` on linux or if you are launching as administrator in an applocker environment on Windows then you would need to launch the application with the following flags `--no-sandbox --disable-gpu-sandbox` to have the application working as expected.
Based on the feedback from [vscode#184687](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/184687) we are adding two new settings to make life easier when there is need to disable the chromium sandbox,

1) A new command line flag `--disable-chromium-sandbox` can now be used to disable the chromium sandbox for all processes in the application, this new flag can be used as a replacement for `--no-sandbox --disable-gpu-sandbox`. This flag will cover any new process sandboxes that might get added by the runtime in future releases.

2) To persist the prefernce of disabling the chromium sandbox across launches, do the following

    * Open the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`).
    * Run the **Preferences: Configure Runtime Arguments** command.
    * This command will open a `argv.json` file to configure runtime arguments. You might see some default arguments there already.
    * Add `"disable-chromium-sandbox": true`.
    * Restart VSCode

**Note:** Do not use this setting unless you are seeing issues!

## Editor

### Skip subword when shrinking and expanding selection

The **Expand** and **Shrink Selection** commands can now be configured to skip subwords. This is done via the `editor.smartSelect.selectSubwords` setting. By default, subwords are selected but this can now be disabled.

* `true` -> Co`|`deEditor selects `[Code]Editor`, then `[CodeEditor]`
* `false` -> Co`|`deEditor selects `[CodeEditor]`

This setting comes in handy when you use expand and shrink selection frequently with multiple cursors and on heterogeneous words.

### Improved Emmet support for CSS modules in JSX/TSX

Emmet supports a new set of abbreviations for JSX/TSX files.
By typing `..test` in a JSX or TSX file, and expanding the abbreviation, one obtains the line `<div styleName={styles.test}></div>`.

The attribute name and value prefix can be configured using the `emmet.syntaxProfiles` setting. By configuring the `emmet.syntaxProfiles` setting as follows:

```json
"emmet.syntaxProfiles": {
    "jsx": {
        "markup.attributes": {
            "class*": "className",
        },
        "markup.valuePrefix": {
            "class*": "myStyles"
        }
    }
}
```

and then expanding the abbreviation `..test` in a JSX or TSX file, one gets the abbreviation
`<div className={myStyles.test}></div>` instead.

### Resizable content hover

It is now possible to resize the content hover widget. One can hover over the widget borders and drag the sashes to change the size of the hover widget.

## Terminal

### Image support

TODO@Tyriar

### Multi-line and range link formats

TODO@Tyriar

### Deprecated shell and shellArgs settings removed

The settings `terminal.integrated.shell.*` and `terminal.integrated.shellArgs.*` were replaced by terminal profiles over a year ago and have just been removed. If you're still using them, here is an example before/after to help with migrating:

```jsonc
// Before
{
  "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "pwsh.exe",
  "terminal.integrated.shellArgs.windows": ["-Login"],

  "terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "bash",
  "terminal.integrated.shellArgs.osx": ["-l"],
}

// After
{
  "terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
    "PowerShell Login": {
      // Source is a special property that will use VS Code's logic to detect
      // the PowerShell or Git Bash executable.
      "source": "PowerShell",
      "args": ["-Login"],
      "icon": "terminal-powershell"
    },
  },

  "terminal.integrated.profiles.osx": {
    // This will override the builtin bash profile
    "bash": {
      "path": "bash",
      "args": ["-l"],
      "icon": "terminal-bash"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Terminal output support

Previously, test output shown in the **Test Results** view would always be shown in an embedded text editor. This stripped it of rich styling such as colors, styles, and symbols it may have had when run in a terminal. In this release, we show output in a real xterm.js terminal.

![](./images/1_80/testing-terminal.png)

*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

Now that the **Test Results** view is fully featured, the commands to **Show Test Output** have been redirected to open the Test Results view instead of creating a temporary terminal.

## Source Control

## Notebooks

## Notebook saving performance improvements for Remote

Previously, saving a notebook in VS Code's Remote extension required sending the entire notebook to the extension host, which could be slow for large notebooks or slow network connections with auto-save enabled. We have improved this by only sending the changes to the notebook to the extension host, resulting in faster notebook saving and executions. While this feature is still disabled by default, we are confident that we will be able to enable it soon. To try it out, add "notebook.experimental.remoteSave": true to your settings. For more details, please follow the issue [vscode#172345](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/172345)


### Interactive Window backup and restore

The python Interactive Window is now fully integrated with the `hot exit` feature and will restore the editor state between vs code reloads. The `interactiveWindow.restore` setting no longer had any effect and has been removed.

Without `hot exit` enabled, a prompt will show upon closing vs code to optionally save as a `.ipynb` file.

## Languages

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_80.md).

### WSL over Tunnels

Last iteration, we previewed connecting to WSL over [Remote Tunnels](/docs/remote/tunnels). This feature is now stable this iteration. If you run a [Remote Tunnel](/docs/remote/tunnels) on a Windows machine with WSL installed, you have the option to connect to WSL directly from the Remote Explorer.

![](./images/1_80/wsl-over-tunnels.png)

*Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong)*

This feature now works on both desktop VS Code installations as well as [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev). If you're already running a tunnel on your Windows device, make sure to update it to the latest version to enable this feature.

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

>**Note**: To get access to the chat view and inline chat, you'll need to sign up for the [GitHub Copilot chat waitlist](https://github.com/github-copilot/chat_waitlist_signup/join).

### Python

#### Deprecation of Python 3.7 support

Python 3.7 reached [end-of-life (EOL) on 2023-06-27](https://peps.python.org/pep-0537/). As such, official support for Python 3.7 from the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) will stop in three months in the 2023.18 release of the extension (which corresponds with the September 2023 release of VS Code). There are no plans to actively remove support for Python 3.7, and so we expect the extension will continue to work unofficially with Python 3.7 for the foreseeable future.

With all other releases of Python now on an annual release cadence, we expect to stop official support for a Python release once it reaches EOL in the first extension release of the following calendar year (i.e., Python 3.8 is scheduled to reach EOL in October 2024, so the first extension release in 2025 will stop official support).

#### Test discovery and run rewrite

This month we are continuing the rollout of our testing rewrite as an experiment. As a reminder, this rewrite redesigns the architecture behind test discovery and execution for both unittest and pytest in the extension. The rewrite is currently active for 100% of VS Code Insiders users and will begin ramping into stable this month. The rewrite will be adopted shortly, but for now the setting to opt-in and out, `pythonTestAdapter`, still exists.

#### Dynamic run results for pytest and unittest

Rolling out with the new experiment is dynamic run results for pytest and unittest. Previously our test results were only returned once all tests finished running, but now with this feature test results will be delivered individually allowing you to see your tests pass and fail in real time.

#### Mypy extension

There is now a [Mypy Type Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.mypy-type-checker) extension that provides linting support for Python using the [mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/) type checker, available in preview as a pre-release version. This new extension offers errors and warnings on your entire codebase, instead of only current files. It also uses `dmypy` for faster type checking.

If you have any issues with this new extension or wish to provide feedback, please file an issue in the [Mypy extension GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mypy/issues).

#### Debugpy extension

When support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 was removed from the Python extension, we received a lot of feedback from users who were unable to upgrade their codebase to the latest versions of Python and lost the ability to debug their applications with the latest versions of the Python extension. To work towards a solution for this, we have created a separate Python Debugger extension called [Debugpy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy). By keeping the debugger separate from the Python extension, you will eventually be able to use the latest version of the Python extension while using an older version of the debugger (by disabling [extensions auto-update](/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md#extension-auto-update)). This extension is available in preview as a pre-release version using the latest version of debugpy. We plan to support older versions in the near future.

Please give it a try and [let us know](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-debugger/issues) if everything works appropriately. Our plan is to deprecate the built-in debugging functionality in favour of this separate extension.

#### Pylance localization

 The [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extension is now localized! This means settings, commands, and other text from the extension will be translated to your preferred language if you have a [Language Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=language%20pack&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories) installed and set to active in VS Code.

#### Index persistance for 3rd-party libraries

Pylance performs indexing of 3rd party libraries that are installed in your environment to enable IntelliSense features such as auto-completion, auto-import, code navigation, etc. Previously, Pylance would index these libraries every time you opened a workspace in VS Code. Now, Pylance will persist the index for these libraries, reducing the need for repetitive indexing processes.

### Jupyter

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues.

* Up to 1000 (from the previous 100) comment threads can be loaded in a pull request.
* The new VS Code API proposal for a read-only message let's you check out a PR directly from an un-checked-out diff.
* Avatars in trees and comments are circles instead of squares.

Review the [changelog for the 0.68.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0680) release of the extension to learn about the other highlights.

## Preview Features

### TypeScript 5.2 support

This update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.2 release. Check out the [TypeScript 5.2 iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/54298) for more details about what the TypeScript team is currently working on. Upcoming tooling highlights include:

* A new **Inline constant** refactoring.
* A new **Move to file** refactoring that lets you move a symbol into an existing file.

To start using the TypeScript 5.2 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) extension.

## Extension authoring

### SecretStorage API now uses Electron API over Keytar

The [SecretStorage API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#SecretStorage) has been the recommended way to store secrets like passwords, access tokens, etc for years now. Under the hood, it has been using [Keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar), an abstraction layer used to store secrets in the OS keyring. Due to the deprecation & archiving of Keytar, we looked to other solutions for the problem specifically looking to our runtime, Electron, for a solution.

This release, we've started the move from Keytar to Electron's [safeStorage API](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/safe-storage). This switch should be totally transparent to you as secrets will be retrieved from keytar and re-stored via Electron's `safeStorage` API. In the future, we will remove this migration so that we can remove our dependency on Keytar altogether.

#### Keytar deprecation plan

For a while now, VS Code has had a pretty big dependency on [Keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar), an abstraction layer used to store secrets in the OS keyring. Additionally, we have included a Keytar shim in VS Code that extensions depended on before the introduction of the [SecretStorage API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#SecretStorage). Keytar itself is [officially archived](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) and not being maintained... In an effort to promote good security practices by **not** depending on an archived piece of software for storing secrets, we are working on a plan to remove this shim from VS Code.

We have already directly reached out to extension authors of popular extensions that still use this Keytar shim... and they are working on moving off of it. We want to communicate this here as well as in [our GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions/662) for those we didn't contact directly so we minimize the disruption due to this change. I know this isn't the best news... we had a fair amount of work to remove our dependency on Keytar as well, but we believe this is the right thing to do to ensure extensions are using secure APIs.

If you are using Keytar directly in your extension, there are a couple of options for you to consider:

* **(recommended)** Use the [SecretStorage API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#SecretStorage) that VS Code provides on the [ExtensionContext](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#ExtensionContext). This API is cross-platform and will work on all platforms that VS Code supports. It is also maintained by the VS Code team and will continue to be maintained and has been a part of the VS Code API for years at this point.
* **(not recommended)** You can bundle the [keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) module with your extension. Keep in mind that keytar is a native node module which means that you will need to [publish a platform specific extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#platformspecific-extensions) for each platform you want to support.

##### Timeline

The current plan is to remove this shim from VS Code Insiders in **early August**, which means that **September 2023's** stable release will be the first release without the shim.

Work for this is being tracked in [issue #115215](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/115215) and if you have any questions, feel free to ask them here in [our GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions/662).

### Improved vscode.fs.writeFile performance for local files

When you are using `vscode.fs.writeFile` API to write data into files (you should!), write operations to files that are local to the extension host will now resolve much faster.

Previously the extension host would delegate the write operation to the VS Code client for execution, but now the operation executes directly inside the extension host, saving round trips.

### Tree checkbox API

The `TreeItem` `checkboxState` API has been finalized. By default, tree items that have checkboxes will have the checked state managed by VS Code. This behavior can be changed by setting the `TreeViewOptions` property `manageCheckboxStateManually` to `true`. When this is set, the extension will be responsible for managing checking and unchecking of parent and child checkboxes.

### EnvironmentVariableCollection.description

This new API allows specifying a description for `EnvironmentVariableCollection`, displayed to the user in the terminal tab hover, explaining what exactly the change is doing.

```ts
// Example of what the Git extension could use
context.environmentVariableCollection.description = 'An explanation of what the environment changes do';
```

You can see the API in action in the builtin Git extension which now describes what the change does:

![Environment variable collection descriptions are explained in a terminal tab's hover](images/1_80/terminal-env-description.png)

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Read-only message for file system providers

When you `registerFileSystemProvider`, you can provide a read-only message instead of simply marking a file system as read-only. This message will show in the editor when a user tries to edit a file from that provider.

![Read-only file system message](images/1_80/read-only-file-message.png)

## Engineering

### Name mangling of exported symbols

Last year we started [mangling the names of private properties and methods](v1_74.md#name-mangling-of-properties-and-method) to reduce our code size. We now also mangle exported symbol names, which reduces the size of our main workbench JavaScript file a further 8%.

Our name mangling build step mangling now saves a total of 3.9MB of JavaScript across core VS Code and our builtin extensions. This reduction speeds up downloads, reduces VS Code's install size, and speeds up code loading every time you start VS Code.

### Checksum integrity checks for Node.js, built-in extensions, and Electron

As part of our build, we consume binary resources from other locations, such as node.js for our remote server, built-in extensions from the marketplace and Electron. In this milestone we added capabilities to ensure the integrity of these binary resources by validating against a SHA256 checksum that is checked into the `vscode` GitHub repository.

### New Linux performance machine

We take performance of VS Code very serious, especially the time it takes to open a text editor and see a blinking cursor. For that purpose we run daily performance tests on Windows and macOS.

This milestone we added a Linux machine to the set, reporting the startup times on Ubuntu 22.

![Linux Performance Machine](images/1_80/linux-perf-bot.png)

### Event emitter optimizations

VS Code uses event emitters extensively throughout our codebase. We've optimized these emitters this iteration which slightly improved startup time and memory usage.

You can read more about this improvement on its [Github issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/185789).

### Terminal pty host improvements

The "Pty Host" process manages all shell processes launched by the terminal, several improvements have been made:

- Performance
  - There is now a direct channel of communication to the pty host process, the most significant change is this will reduce the input latency of the terminal
  - Reconnection (reload window) and process revival (restart) performance has been improved by reducing unneeded calls and parallelizing tasks when there are multiple terminals being restored
  - We now gather performance metrics on terminal startup and reconnection which can be viewed via the `Developer: Startup Performance` command
- Diagnostic
  - All terminal-related logs have moved out of the "Window" output channel and into the new "Terminal" output channel
  - When trace log level is on the "Pty Host" output channel will log all RPC calls which will help a lot in diagnosing terminal problems

## Notable fixes

* Loses text when maximizing the integrated terminal [#134448](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/134448)
* Support fish shell integration automatic injection [#139400](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/139400)
