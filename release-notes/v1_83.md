### Settings editor search adjustments

The Settings editor now shows fewer results for a given search query to reduce noise.
For users with GitHub Copilot Chat, in addition to settings found by keyword matches, only the top five Copilot Chat setting matches are chosen now, rather than the top fifteen.

The search results are also now ordered by the Settings editor table of contents to show commonly used settings at the top, and to show filtered extension settings in their original order. To revert to ordering the search results by match type and score, set the `workbench.settings.settingsSearchTocBehavior` setting to `"hide"`, clear the search query, and start another search.

## Extension Authoring

### Support for Unicode character class escapes in string settings

[Unicode character class escapes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Unicode_character_class_escape) are now supported in string and string array settings.
In other words, string settings can now specify a `pattern` field with a value such as `"\\p{Letter}+"`, which allows setting string values that only contain letters.

Support for Unicode character class escapes is not available for object settings with string values at this time.
