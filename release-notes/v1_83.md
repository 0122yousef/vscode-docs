# September 2023 (version 1.83)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the September 2023 release of Visual Studio Code. There are many updates in this version that we hope you'll like, some of the key highlights include:

TODO @gregvanl

## Accessibility

## Editor

### Activate Nearest Quick Fix using the Quick Fix Hotekey

There is a new setting that allows you to activate the nearest Quick Fix in a line from `Ctrl + . ` or from the hotkey (`editor.action.quickFix`), no matter where your cursor is in that line.

Code that will be refactored or fixed with Quick Fixes this way will be highlighted. Normal Code Actions and non-fix refactorings can still be activated at the cursor location. Make sure to enable _Code Action Widget: Include Nearby Quickfixes_ or configure the `editor.codeActionWidget.includeNearbyQuickfixes` setting.

## Workbench

### Similar Command results in the Command Palette

Finding the command you're looking for can be challenging. In VS Code alone there are over 2000 commands... and with your favorite extensions, that number can soar even higher. We wanted to introduce a way to help you find what you're looking for while still keeping the speed that the Command Palette offers today. To do this, we are including a new section in the Command Palette results called "similar commands". Here are some examples:

#### A query no longer has to "fuzzily" match to show up in the results. Like "Toggle Auto Save"

!['turn on auto save' and 'Toggle Auto Save' showed up in a similar results section](images/1_83/similar-commands-3.png)

#### If there _are_ fuzzy results though, those still show up at the top and similar commands follow

![user searched for 'change language' and 'Configure Display Language' showed up in a similar results section](images/1_83/similar-commands-2.png)

#### Even extension contribute commands get picked up

![user searched for 'show git blame' and 'toggle file blame' showed up in a similar results section](images/1_83/similar-commands.png)

We think that this will really help those that struggle to remember the exact command name... let's be honest, that's pretty much all of us at some point.

This is just the first cut of this new feature and still requires matching exact words in command names. In the future you can see:
* commands matching based on a non-visible description that the command has
* better basic handling of synonyms ("toggle" and "turn on/off", "show" and "reveal", etc)

Let us know what you think!

### Settings editor search adjustments

The Settings editor now shows fewer results for a given search query to reduce noise.
For users with GitHub Copilot Chat, in addition to settings found by keyword matches, only the top five Copilot Chat setting matches are chosen now, rather than the top fifteen.

The search results are also now ordered by the Settings editor table of contents to show commonly used settings at the top, and to show filtered extension settings in their original order. To revert to ordering the search results by match type and score, set the `workbench.settings.settingsSearchTocBehavior` setting to `"hide"`, clear the search query, and start another search.

### Improved overflow behavior for editor actions

When the number of editor actions exceeds the available space, they overflow into the `...` menu. We have refined this logic and some vital actions, like close or split editor, are now excepted. This means that they will always be visible, even if the available space is limited.

### Command Center and Debug Toolbar

There is a new _experimental_ setting that allows you to show the Debug Toolbar inside the Command Center. Make sure to have the command center enabled and configure the `debug.debugToolbarLocation` setting:

```
"debug.toolBarLocation": "commandCenter"
```

![Debug Controls inside Command Center](images/1_83/cc-debugtoolbar.png)

### Color Theme picker now shows the id next to the theme name

The Color Theme picker now shows the localized name of the color theme and the id next to it. This was done to help users who use a non-English language pack but only know the English name of the theme.

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Improvements to `/tests`

We have improved `/tests` - for panel and inline chat. It is now better in picking up what testing framework you are using and will generate new tests in the same style. Also, it should be much better with suggesting names for new test files, like test_foo.py for foo.py and bar.test.js for bar.js.

#### Inline chat goes multi-turn

Inline chat now keeps all prompts of the current session which enables you to refer to previous messages and to reply to questions.

### Ask GitHub Copilot defaults to the chat view

A few months ago, we introduced an "Ask GitHub Copilot" option in the Command Palette which allowed you to take your query in the command palette and open that in a chat with GitHub Copilot in the event that the options in the Command Palette didn't satify the query.

We gathered feedback on what experience the "Ask GitHub Copilot" option in the Command Palette should open: the chat view in the side bar or Quick Chat. In an effort to make the first time experience more aligned with what folks are more familiar with, we chose the chat view.

<video src="images/1_83/askchat-in-panel.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Ask GitHub Copilot opens in the Chat View"></video>

With that said, if you would like this to open in Quick Chat, we have introduced a setting to do exactly that:
```
"workbench.commandPalette.experimental.askChatLocation": "quickChat"
```

Let us know what you think!

### Command Palette similar commands

This iteration, we shipped the [similar commands](#similar-command-results-in-the-command-palette) feature in the Command Palette. Copilot Chat users get an even better similar commands experience because we can leverage Copilot AI smarts to determine similarity. These smarts help with synonyms, intent and in our testing, Copilot was able to handle similarity across spoken languages as well. Finding the exact command you're looking for in the Command Palette has never been easier!

### Python

#### Python Debugger extension updates

The [Debugpy extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy), which was [announced a few months ago](/release-notes/v1_80.md#debugpy-extension), has been renamed to "Python Debugger" for improved discoverability in the marketplace.

This extension now includes a new User setting `debugpy.debugJustMyCode` that when disabled, it allows you to step into system or third party libraries code for all your applications -- by default, the debugger steps only into the code that is defined in your own Python code. This was a popular feature request for those who wanted to more conveniently disable `justMyCode` to all of their projects, instead of having to manually configure it in all of their projects' `launch.json` debug configurations.

To try it out, make sure you have the [Python Debugger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy) installed. Then open the settings UI (File > Preferences > Settings), search for "debugJustMyCode" and disable the checkbox:

![Searching "debugJustMyCode" in the Settings editor results in the debugpy.debugJustMyCode setting appearing at the top.](images/1_83/debugpy-debug-just-my-code.png)

Now once you create a `launch.json` file, it will use the value of `debugpy.debugJustMyCode` by default, as long as `justMyCode` is not specified in the file. Note that when `justMyCode` is specified, its value will take precedence over the `debugpy.debugJustMyCode` setting.

#### Update on call argument inlay hints setting

Previously, [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)'s setting to enable inlay hints for partial call arguments (`python.analysis.inlayHints.callArgumentNames`) could only be set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable type hints for call arguments. This setting has been modified to allow more granular control over the type hints that are shown for call arguments.
It can now be set to `partial` to disable hints for [positional-only](https://peps.python.org/pep-0570/) and [keyword-only](https://peps.python.org/pep-3102/) parameters,  `all` to enable them or `off` to disable them completely.


## Extension Authoring

### Support for Unicode character class escapes in string settings

[Unicode character class escapes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Unicode_character_class_escape) are now supported in string and string array settings.
In other words, string settings can now specify a `pattern` field with a value such as `"\\p{Letter}+"`, which allows setting string values that only contain letters.

Support for Unicode character class escapes is not available for object settings with string values at this time.

## Engineering

### Floating editor windows exploration

We have started to explore how to allow for editors to be pulled out of the workbench window into their own windows. This feature is our highest upvoted [feature request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10121) and we plan to have a first working version for our insiders users to play with in October.

<video src="images/1_83/floating-windows.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Floating Editor Windows"></video>

All editors across all windows operate on the same underlying editor models, so that changes made in one window are reflected live in all other windows. You can create any editor layout in the floating windows and open any editor you like in how many windows you want.

For our first working version we envision that the status bar would also be present in the floating windows so that editor information - such as line numbers and selection ranges - can be shown. Stay tuned for more development in this feature are over the coming months!


### vscode.dev is now cross origin isolated

Cross origin isolation is now enabled for [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev). This enables new powerful features like shared array buffers which is the building block for cross file TypeScript support, Python exeuction in the web, and [vscode-wasm-wasi](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2023/06/05/vscode-wasm-wasi) in general.
