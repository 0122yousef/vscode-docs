Terminal:

- aligned terminal quick fixes with code actions in massive refactor, took a lot of time, wasn't clear what Matt wanted
- focus accessible buffer allows screen reader users to navigate through the buffer via keyboard with shell integration powered navigation
- terminal accessibility help menu & refactor to make it even more accessible, shared with terminal accessible buffer for minimal redudancy

Tasks:

- thought about improving discoverabiilty and ease of access - added actions to terminal dropdown

Accessibility:

- Thought deeply about the experience for both beginner and power screen reader users. Selfhosted, met weekly with JooYoung, communicated with Isidor, and engaged with the community to improve both of these.
- added audio cues to indicate notebook cell execution result, DiffEditor line type (inserted, modified, deleted), DiffReview action change type, terminal command failure
- To accept a notification's primary action, users have historically needed to navigate to the Notification Center. **Notifications: Accept Notification Primary Action** (`kb(notification.acceptPrimaryAction)`) runs the primary action without leaving the current context.
- Created `acessibility.verbosity` setting concept to reduce cognitive load for screen reader users. Screen reader users can exclude hints from a feature's `aria-label` to decrease redundancy and cognitive load.
- We now cache audio cues so they only have to be loaded once, yielding better responsiveness, and have improved the tones used for the diff editor.
- When `Go to Line/Column... kb(workbench.action.gotoLine)` is invoked, the screen reader now reads the associated line content.
- Improved aria labels across the product to present content in better order for swifter navigation
- Merge editor

Copilot:

- Drove and contributed to accessibility improvments in the chat view and interactive editor session
- Devised new methodology via discussion with Kai for ensuring accessibility in our product going forward for new features
- Custom accessibility help menu for chat view / interactive editor session
- Announce content to screen reader users as it comes in
- Discussions with Amnon (ad nauseum) about the audio cue we will use for this
