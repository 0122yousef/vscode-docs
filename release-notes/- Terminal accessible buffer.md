Terminal accessible buffer

Historically, the terminal buffer has been a black box for SR users. This feature enables them to navigate it line by line, character by character. Discussions with JooYoung and Daniel contributed to this idea. While the terminal accessible buffer was created with SR users in mind, it offers tremendous benefit to everyone as it leverages editor features like keyboard selection. As for the implementation, I first met with Peng. We talked through performance implications and he suggested we might need a language provider. After digging into the code, that seemed like it might just complicate things, but the discussion was still helpful. Leveraging the shell integration that Daniel and I developed and insights from JooYoung / the community, this was improved upon with the addition of `Go to command` navigation and more.

Accessiblity help menus

Daniel and I had hoped that shell integration features such as `Run Recent Command` would be helpful for SR users in particular. I learned during my meetings with JooYoung that SR users often use Command Prompt and that these  features were not discoverable. I recalled that the editor had a help menu and suggested we do something like that for the terminal. We could tell a SR user about this menu when they focused the terminal. The menu could be context aware - for example, telling a Command Prompt user to consider switching to PowerShell for an enhanced experience. The initial terminal help menu was deemed inaccessible by one of our power users because it would require special document navigation that beginners might not know. Having just impelemented the terminal accessible buffer, something with an underlying monacof-editor, I imagined we should do the same here. I made sure to share code between the terminal accessible buffer and accessibility help menu. It was a large refactor and decent amount of work, but users were very pleased. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/173911#issuecomment-1505602012

Accessibility verbosity settings

After using VoiceOver for awhile, I noticed that sometimes messages would be repeated. I wondered if this was annoying, so created an issue and sought community feedback. The ruling was yes and I learned that some SRs have a setting for this. I implemented `terminal`, `notebook`, `diffEditor`, and AI `chat`/ `interactive editor session` `accessiblity.verbosity` settings to reduce cognitive load / noise. This setting is important because it lets us be more verbose with hints - putting them where they're needed by beginners, without fearing that it will forever annoy others. Something I'm still thinking about is how we should let users know this such a setting exists. My hope is that since some SRs have such a setting, they will go looking for it. I sought the review of various area owners like Rob, Jo, Henning, and Peng for these changes.

AI chat / interactive editor session

I began by testing and creating issues related to the AI SR experience. For example, I noticed that we weren't letting a SR user know when a response had come in. I discussed this with JooYoung and determined that we should be alerting with the reply and using a typing audio cue on loop during the "thinking" phase.

I have been communicating at length with Amnon, our sound designer, about the "thinking" audio cue. He had agreed to send it to me by Friday of last week, but on that day, said that we instead need to meet at the end of next week citing that this has "major implications across products." I am not sure about that and have found meetings with him to be long and unnecessary. Isidor said he has a similar read on the situation with Amnon. In the meantime, I worked with Rob to alert SR users when a response comes in.

I explored using monaco-editors in the chat view so that SR users can navigate each reply/response with arrow keys, but deferred that when JooYoung brought some more fundamental issues with the experience to my attention - it was unclear how to interact with these even for him, a power SR user.

I added a help menu for chat & one for the interactive editor session, indicating how to access it in the aria label with an asscoaited `accessiblity.verbosity` setting as mentioned above. I initially created overlay widgets, but then realized there could be a more lightweight way to accomplish the same thing. I simply set the value of each feature's input box. I have ongoing discussions with Rob and Jo about some other issues with the current experience.

Other accessibility improvements:

I added audio cues to indicate notebook cell execution result, DiffReview action change type, and terminal command failure. I also improved audio cue performance by caching after first play, which built upon Henning's audio cue work.

I drove and implemented some notebook accessiblity improvements - meeting with JooYoung and working with Peng & Aaron.

I improved aria labels in search, debug, editor, and more so that their content was presented in the most logical and concise way. Collaboration and review by Jo, Andrea, and others was helpful.

I provided a way to accept notification via keyboard without losing context and worked with Ben to accomplish this.

I created a new accessibility testing protocol for features, spent time testing the new and old features to identify and collaborate on issues with area owners. This evolved through sharing with the team and seeking feedback and discussion/refinment with Kai. I have been creating issues, fixing things, and working with Jo/Rob on the AI experience acessibility as I touched on above.
