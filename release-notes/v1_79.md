### Automatic shell integration for fish shell

[Shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) and its enhanced user experience will now automatically activate for fish shell. You may need to update fish for this to work.

### Overline support

The overline escape sequences (`SGR 53`, `SGR 55`) specified in from ECMA-48 are now supported in the terminal. The most common use of this sequence is to add a line above an app's "status bar" on the bottom row of the terminal.

![The overline feature is similar to underline but will draw a line on top of the text](images/1_79/terminal-overline.png)


### Images in the terminal

Experimental support for images in the terminal has been added. Images in a terminal typically work by encoding the image pixel data as text which is written to the terminal via a special escape sequence. The current protocols that are supported are sixel and the [inline images protocol pioneered by iTerm](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). Enable this feature by setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.experimentalImageSupport": true
```

Once done, to test it you can download and `cat` a `.six` example file from [the libsixel repository](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel/tree/master/images):

Or use the [imgcat python package](https://pypi.org/project/imgcat/) or [imgcat script](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html) with a png, gif or jpg file:

The current limitations of this feature are:

- Serialization does not work, so reloading a terminal will not retain any images (tracked in [jerch/xterm-addon-image#47](https://github.com/jerch/xterm-addon-image/issues/47))
- Copying the selection as HTML does not include the selected image (tracked in [jerch/xterm-addon-image#50](https://github.com/jerch/xterm-addon-image/issues/50))
- Animated gifs don't work (tracked in [jerch/xterm-addon-image#51](https://github.com/jerch/xterm-addon-image/issues/51))
- Images that are shorter than a cell will not work properly, this is a [design flaw with the sequences and also occurs in XTerm](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/183840#issuecomment-1569345048)

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_79.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### GHPR integration

When the extension `Github Pull Requests and Issues` is installed and enabled and one is viewing a review thread, it is now possible to directly apply a review comment using Copilot. To this effect use the `Apply Suggestion with AI` button in the comment menu.

## Proposed APIs

### EnvironmentVariableCollection.description

This proposal allows specifying a description for `EnvironmentVariableCollection` that will surface to the user in the terminal tab hover, explaining what the change is doing exactly.

```ts
// Example of what the git extension could use
context.environmentVariableCollection.description = 'Enables VS Code-based git authentication';
```

TODO@Tyriar: Image

### EnvironmentVariableMutator.options

This proposal adds options that can be provided to `EnvironmentVariableMutator`s, allowing to specify when exactly the environment variable change is applied, either on process creation or in the shell integration script (after shell init scripts have run).

```ts
const collection = context.environmentVariableCollection;
// Apply only when the process is created
collection.replace('FOO', 'bar');
// Apply only during the shell integration script
collection.replace('FOO', 'bar', { applyAtProcessCreation: false, applyAtShellIntegration: true });
// Apply twice, during process creation and the shell integration script
collection.replace('FOO', 'bar', { applyAtProcessCreation: true, applyAtShellIntegration: true });
```

### Share Provider

The Share API proposal allows extensions to provide ways to share resources in VS Code. Share provider results are currently surfaced as a top-level `Share...` command palette action and as a new icon near the command center, provided you have opted in with `"workbench.experimental.share.enabled": true` and `"window.commandCenter": true`:
![Share... icon next to the command center](images/v1_79/share-proposal.png)

Please leave feedback on the [API proposal issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/176316).

## Engineering

### Milestone Automation

We have implemented automated milestone replication throughout all of our GitHub repositories. This means that the monthly milestones established in `microsoft/vscode` serve as the foundation for all other milestones that are created and maintained.
