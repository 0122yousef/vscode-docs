## Accessibility

### Settings editor

VoiceOver on macOS now reads the descriptions of enum setting options in the Settings editor.
Try it out with enum settings such as `files.autoSave` and `editor.accessibilitySupport`.

## Workbench

### Continue Working On

The [Continue Working On](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github#_continue-working-on) feature allows you to store and retrieve working changes between VS Code development environments for the same repository, e.g. when you upgrade from a local git repository to a GitHub codespace, or when you switch between different machines for the same repository.

You can now transfer working changes between development environments for a GitHub repository even if it is configured with an HTTP remote in one environment and an SSH remote in another. Additionally, we have started to transfer additional workbench state, such as your source control view state preference, for a more seamless transition.

## Editor

## Terminal

### Automatic shell integration for fish shell

[Shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) and its enhanced user experience will now automatically activate for fish shell. You may need to update fish for this to work.

### Overline support

The overline escape sequences (`SGR 53`, `SGR 55`) specified in from ECMA-48 are now supported in the terminal. The most common use of this sequence is to add a line above an app's "status bar" on the bottom row of the terminal.

![The overline feature is similar to underline but will draw a line on top of the text](images/1_79/terminal-overline.png)


### Images in the terminal

Experimental support for images in the terminal has been added. Images in a terminal typically work by encoding the image pixel data as text which is written to the terminal via a special escape sequence. The current protocols that are supported are sixel and the [inline images protocol pioneered by iTerm](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). Enable this feature by setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.experimentalImageSupport": true
```

Once done, to test it you can download and `cat` a `.six` example file from [the libsixel repository](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel/tree/master/images):

Or use the [imgcat python package](https://pypi.org/project/imgcat/) or [imgcat script](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html) with a png, gif or jpg file:

The current limitations of this feature are:

- Serialization does not work, so reloading a terminal will not retain any images (tracked in [jerch/xterm-addon-image#47](https://github.com/jerch/xterm-addon-image/issues/47))
- Copying the selection as HTML does not include the selected image (tracked in [jerch/xterm-addon-image#50](https://github.com/jerch/xterm-addon-image/issues/50))
- Animated gifs don't work (tracked in [jerch/xterm-addon-image#51](https://github.com/jerch/xterm-addon-image/issues/51))
- Images that are shorter than a cell will not work properly, this is a [design flaw with the sequences and also occurs in XTerm](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/183840#issuecomment-1569345048)

## Source Control

### Branch picker integration with vscode.dev and GitHub

You can now checkout a branch in vscode.dev or open it on GitHub.com from the branch picker on VS Code desktop.

## Notebooks

### Rich Content Search

You can now search for rich content in open notebooks from the search viewlet! This means that, if your notebook is open, the search viewlet will show results based on how it appears in the notebook editor (rather than searching the content of the raw source file). This also allows for replacing text in the notebook inputs.

<video src="images/1_79/rich-content-notebook-search.mp4" controls title="Rich Content Notebook Search"></video>

Using the new notebook search toggle, you can also filter which types of cell content you would like to search in.

## Languages

## Testing

## VS Code for the Web

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_79.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### GHPR integration

When the extension `Github Pull Requests and Issues` is installed and enabled and one is viewing a review thread, it is now possible to directly apply a review comment using Copilot. To this effect use the `Apply Suggestion with AI` button in the comment menu.

## Preview features

## Extension authoring

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### EnvironmentVariableCollection.description

This proposal allows specifying a description for `EnvironmentVariableCollection` that will surface to the user in the terminal tab hover, explaining what the change is doing exactly.

```ts
// Example of what the git extension could use
context.environmentVariableCollection.description = 'Enables VS Code-based git authentication';
```

TODO@Tyriar: Image

### EnvironmentVariableMutator.options

This proposal adds options that can be provided to `EnvironmentVariableMutator`s, allowing to specify when exactly the environment variable change is applied, either on process creation or in the shell integration script (after shell init scripts have run).

```ts
const collection = context.environmentVariableCollection;
// Apply only when the process is created
collection.replace('FOO', 'bar');
// Apply only during the shell integration script
collection.replace('FOO', 'bar', { applyAtProcessCreation: false, applyAtShellIntegration: true });
// Apply twice, during process creation and the shell integration script
collection.replace('FOO', 'bar', { applyAtProcessCreation: true, applyAtShellIntegration: true });
```

### Share Provider

The [Share API proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4137aa15f55c5ec3777daf6684908f64b439f6aa/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.shareProvider.d.ts) allows extensions to provide ways to share resources in VS Code.

Share provider results are currently surfaced as a top-level `Share...` command palette action and as a new icon near the command center, provided you have opted in with `"workbench.experimental.share.enabled": true` and `"window.commandCenter": true`:

<video src="images/v1_79/share-provider.mp4" controls title="Share... icon next to the command center"></video>

Please leave feedback on the [API proposal issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/176316).

## Engineering

### Milestone Automation

We have implemented automated milestone replication throughout all of our GitHub repositories. This means that the monthly milestones established in `microsoft/vscode` serve as the foundation for all other milestones that are created and maintained.
