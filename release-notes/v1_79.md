### Milestone Automation

We have implemented automated milestone replication throughout all of our GitHub repositories. This means that the monthly milestones established in `microsoft/vscode` serve as the foundation for all other milestones that are created and maintained.

### GitHub Copilot

#### GHPR integration

When the extension `Github Pull Requests and Issues` is installed and enabled and one is viewing a review thread, it is now possible to directly apply a review comment using Copilot. To this effect use the `Apply Suggestion with AI` button in the comment menu.
