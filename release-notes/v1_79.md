## Accessibility

### Verbosity settings

Additional `accessibility.verbosity` settings have been added to inform screen reader users how to interact with features when they are focused.

`accessibility.verbosity.chat` and `accessibility.verbosity.interactiveEditor` hints describe how to access the accessible help menus for the Copilot chat view and in editor code chat.

These menus provide information about what to expect, how to navigate from the input box to other elements, and more.

`accessibility.verbosity.keybindingsEditor` and `accessibility.verbosity.notebook` indicate how to take context specific actions.

### Settings editor

VoiceOver on macOS now reads the descriptions of enum setting options in the Settings editor.
Try it out with enum settings such as `files.autoSave` and `editor.accessibilitySupport`.

## Workbench

### Continue Working On

The [Continue Working On](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github#_continue-working-on) feature allows you to store and retrieve working changes between VS Code development environments for the same repository, e.g. when you upgrade from a local git repository to a GitHub codespace, or when you switch between different machines for the same repository.

You can now transfer working changes between development environments for a GitHub repository even if it is configured with an HTTP remote in one environment and an SSH remote in another. Additionally, we have started to transfer additional workbench state, such as your source control view state preference, for a more seamless transition.

### Readonly Mode

In some cases it can be helpful to explicitly mark some of the workspace folders or files as readonly for example when their contents is being managed by a different process (such as the `node_modules` folder that is managed by node.js package manager).

For this scenario new settings have been added to mark file paths as readonly in the explorer and in text and notebook editors:
* `files.readonlyInclude`: paths or glob patterns that will make a file be readonly if matching
* `files.readonlyExclude`: paths or glob patterns that will skip files from being readonly when they match `files.readonlyInclude`
* `files.readonlyFromPermissions`: whether a file that has no write-permissions on disk should be readonly

According to the rules of the settings, if a path is considered to be readonly, you cannot modify it from the explorer (e.g. delete it) and you will see a readonly text or notebook editor.

<video src="images/1_79/readonly-mode.mp4" controls title="Readonly mode"></video>

For more ad-hoc toggling of the readonly mode, new commands have been added that allow to change the mode for the current session only, overruling what the settings configure:
* `Set Active Editor Readonly in Session`: mark active editor readonly
* `Set Active Editor Writeable in Session`: mark active editor writeable
* `Toggle Active Editor Readonly in Session`: toggle between readonly and writeable
* `Clear Active Editor Readonly in Session`: reset the session state

### Windows UNC host allow list improvements

As part of an [important security fix](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/security/advisories/GHSA-mmfh-4pv3-39hr), VS Code in the last milestone introduced an allow-list for UNC hosts. This milestone we addressed many of the usability problems that were reported from our fellow Windows users shortly after that leverage UNC paths in their day to day work with VS Code.

#### Dialog improvements

The dialog that asks for confirmation to allow a UNC host on startup now allows to update the `security.allowedUNCHosts` setting and add the host when you click the checkbox.

![Windows UNC allow dialog](images/1_79/unc-dialog.png)

In addition, clicking the "Learn More" button no longer closes the dialog.

#### New `security.restrictUNCAccess` setting

A new setting `security.restrictUNCAccess` allows to disable the UNC allow-list for hosts and restore the behaviour how it used to be without this security fix. We strongly advise against changing this setting though as it makes your system vulnerable again to the [Information Disclosure Vulnerability](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/security/advisories/GHSA-mmfh-4pv3-39hr).

### New tab sizing option `fixed`

A new option for the `workbench.editor.tabSizing` setting named `fixed` was added that will give each tab an equal width. When space gets limited, tabs will shrink equally up to a minimum. The new setting `workbench.editor.tabSizingFixedMaxWidth` allows to set the initial size of tab.

<video src="images/1_79/tab-size-fixed.mp4" controls title="Fixed tab size"></video>

In this mode when you rapidly close tabs using the mouse, the widths of tabs remain stable to allow for closing each tab by clicking onto the same point. The width is then adjusted when you leave the mouse from the tab stripe area.

### Network quality indication

When you are connected to a remote, the best experience for VS Code remote editing capabilities requires a good network connection with low latency. In this milestone we updated the remote indicator in the status bar to give you some feedback when either latency is very high or the network connection appears to be offline.

#### High latency (web, desktop)

We periodically measure the latency to the remote you are connected to. When a certain threshold is hit, the remote indicator will update to reflect that.

![Slow network detection](images/1_79/slow-network.png)

#### Offline detection (web only)

If you are using a web browser to connect to a remote and you suddenly loose internet connection, the remote indicator will update to reflect that.

![Web offline dection](images/1_79/offline-indication.gif)

## Editor

### Paste as

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Quick Suggestions and Snippets

Quick suggestions means that VS Code will show suggestions as you type, without having to press `Ctrl+Space`. This feature is widely popular, around 90% of all suggestion sessions are started by typing. A large amount of suggestions are accepted via `Tab` (vs `Enter` and typing accept characters).

When a snippet is being inserted, the `Tab` key is used to navigate between snippet placeholders. Now, when quick suggestion becomes active while a snippet is being inserted, the `Tab` key can accept a completion _or_ navigate to the next snippet placeholder. To resolve this conflict we have the `editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions` which allows to disable quick suggestions while a snippet is being inserted. It defaulted to `true` and as long as this settings exists we have received feedback that it is confusing. So we have decided to change its default to `false`, meaning typing inside a snippet placeholder will trigger quick suggestions, pressing `Tab` will accept a completion, `Escape` will hide quick suggestions, and `Tab` without suggestion will navigate to the next snippet placeholder.



## Terminal

### Automatic shell integration for fish shell

[Shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) and its enhanced user experience will now automatically activate for fish shell. You may need to update fish for this to work.

TODO@Tyriar: Image

## Tasks

The task presentation option to [`close`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/1899f626fdca44ff80c34ac0f0fe13fc0d3d0856/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L7447-L7450) the terminal on task completion has been finalized.

### Overline support

The overline escape sequences (`SGR 53`, `SGR 55`) specified in from ECMA-48 are now supported in the terminal. The most common use of this sequence is to add a line above an app's "status bar" on the bottom row of the terminal.

![The overline feature is similar to underline but will draw a line on top of the text](images/1_79/terminal-overline.png)

## Source Control

### Branch picker integration with vscode.dev and GitHub

You can now checkout a branch in vscode.dev or open it on GitHub.com from the branch picker on VS Code desktop.

<video src="images/1_79/git-branch-picker.mp4" controls title="Open a branch on GitHub.com from the branch picker"></video>

## Notebooks

### Rich Content Search

You can now search for rich content in open notebooks from the search viewlet! This means that, if your notebook is open, the search viewlet will show results based on how it appears in the notebook editor (rather than searching the content of the raw source file). This also allows for replacing text in the notebook inputs.

<video src="images/1_79/rich-content-notebook-search.mp4" controls title="Rich Content Notebook Search"></video>

Using the new notebook search toggle, you can also filter which types of cell content you would like to search in.

<video src="images/1_79/rich-content-notebook-search-toggle.mp4" controls title="Rich Content Notebook Toggle Cell Content"></video>

## Languages

### TypeScript 5.1

VS Code now ships with TypeScript 5.1.3. This major update brings new TypeScript language features, improved performance, and many important improvements and bug fixes. You can read about TypeScript 5.1 on the [TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-1).

### Linked editing for JSX Tags

With linked editing, when you change an opening JSX Tag VS Code will automatically update the corresponding closing tag. This can be a great time saver:

<!-- TODO: mjbvz image -->

The feature is off by default but can be enabled by setting:

```json
"editor.linkedEditing": true
```

### JSDoc `@param` completions

When writing JSDoc comments, we now show suggestions for all missing parameters:

![JS Doc @param completions in a TypeScript file](images/1_79/js-param.png)

This can help you quickly fill in the documentation.

In JavaScript files, `@param` completions create placeholders for the parameter type its description:

<video title="@param completions in a JavaScript file" src="images/1_79/js-param-snippets.mp4" controls autoplay loop muted></video>

### Copy media files in to workspace on drop / paste for Markdown

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Insert audio into Markdown

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Syntax highlighting for JSON with Lines (JSONL) files

[JSON with Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) describe a sequence of JSON objects seperated by newline characters. If the file extension `jsonl` is used, VS Code will provide syntax highlighting.

## Testing

## VS Code for the Web

### Project wide JS/TS IntelliSense on vscode.dev

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_79.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Editor Chat

We have improved editor chat, most notably we have changed its default mode to be "livePreview". In this mode changes are applied directly to the document and are shown with an embedded diff view. Let's look at the example below:

* a new property was added to the `IUserFriendlyStatusItemEntry`-type and
* Copilot was asked to update the `isUserFriendlyStatusItemEntry`-check accordingly
* the reply is shown in the editor using an embedded diff view. Its right hand side is editable and checked by VS Code's language extensions
* this allows to spot an error in the reply, the `isMarkdownString` function doesn't exist, and you, the Pilot, can fix it before accepting the suggestion

![Alt text](<images/1_79/copilot-editor-chat.png>)


#### GHPR integration

When the extension `Github Pull Requests and Issues` is installed and enabled and one is viewing a review thread, it is now possible to directly apply a review comment using Copilot. To this effect use the `Apply Suggestion with AI` button in the comment menu.

<video src="images/1_79/copilot-ghpr-apply-suggestion.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted  title="Apply GHPR Review Commment with Copilot"></video>

#### Experimental Quick Question experience

<video src="images/1_79/quick-question.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Ask a quick question with Copilot"></video>

> _Theme: [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda)_

This iteration, we experimented with leveraging chat to ask quick programming questions without leaving context. If you have access to the chat experience, you can enable this feature with the following setting:

```json
"chat.experimental.quickQuestion.enable": true
```

Feature overview:
* Ask Copilot a quick question
* Toggle the experience with `cmd/ctrl+shift+i` (state is remembered for 30s so you can easy show, hide, and show again)
* An "Open in chat" button for continuing the conversation to a long form chat in the chat view

### Jupyter

#### Resume execution of cells against [Remote Jupyter Kernels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-kernel-management#_existing-jupyter-server) after reloading VS Code

The Jupyter Extension now supports resuming execution of cells against [Remote Jupyter Kernels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-kernel-management#_existing-jupyter-server), if the cell is still busy executing even when re-opening the Notebook after having shutdown VS Code.

For instance assume one executes a long running block of code such as training of a model against a Remote Jupyter kernel. As this could take a few minutes or longer, one decides to shutdown VS Code in the interim. A few minutes later VS Code is restarted and the same notebook opened, if the cell is still busy executing, this state is reflected in the Notebook cell and any new output would continue to get displayed in the cell output.

If on the other hand, the cell completed execution while VS Code was shutdown, the outputs generated in the interim would not be preserved in the notebook.
Resuming executions in this manner and displaying of new outputs are limited to simple outputs such as plain text, html, images, images and the like. Restoring state of Widgets and other such complex outputs is not supported.

![Notebook built-in error renderer](images/1_79/resumeNBCellExec.gif)

## Preview features

### Images in the terminal

Experimental support for images in the terminal has been added. Images in a terminal typically work by encoding the image pixel data as text which is written to the terminal via a special escape sequence. The current protocols that are supported are sixel and the [inline images protocol pioneered by iTerm](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). Enable this feature by setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.experimentalImageSupport": true
```

Once done, to test it you can download and `cat` a `.six` example file from [the libsixel repository](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel/tree/master/images):

TODO@Tyriar: Image

Or use the [imgcat python package](https://pypi.org/project/imgcat/) or [imgcat script](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html) with a png, gif or jpg file:

TODO@Tyriar: Image

The current limitations of this feature are:

- Serialization does not work, so reloading a terminal will not retain any images (tracked in [jerch/xterm-addon-image#47](https://github.com/jerch/xterm-addon-image/issues/47))
- Copying the selection as HTML does not include the selected image (tracked in [jerch/xterm-addon-image#50](https://github.com/jerch/xterm-addon-image/issues/50))
- Animated gifs don't work (tracked in [jerch/xterm-addon-image#51](https://github.com/jerch/xterm-addon-image/issues/51))
- Images that are shorter than a cell will not work properly, this is a [design flaw with the sequences and also occurs in XTerm](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/183840#issuecomment-1569345048)

### TypeScript 5.2 support

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Move to file Refactoring for JavaScript and TypeScript

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Extension authoring

### Improved `vscode.fs` performance for local files

When you are using `vscode.fs` API to work with files (you should!), operations to files that are local to the extension host will now resolve much faster.

Previously the extension host would delegate these operations to the VS Code client for execution, but now they will execute directly inside the extension host, saving round trips.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### EnvironmentVariableCollection.description

This proposal allows specifying a description for `EnvironmentVariableCollection` that will surface to the user in the terminal tab hover, explaining what the change is doing exactly.

```ts
// Example of what the git extension could use
context.environmentVariableCollection.description = 'Enables VS Code-based git authentication';
```

TODO@Tyriar: Image

### EnvironmentVariableMutator.options

This proposal adds options that can be provided to `EnvironmentVariableMutator`s, allowing to specify when exactly the environment variable change is applied, either on process creation or in the shell integration script (after shell init scripts have run).

```ts
const collection = context.environmentVariableCollection;
// Apply only when the process is created
collection.replace('FOO', 'bar');
// Apply only during the shell integration script
collection.replace('FOO', 'bar', { applyAtProcessCreation: false, applyAtShellIntegration: true });
// Apply twice, during process creation and the shell integration script
collection.replace('FOO', 'bar', { applyAtProcessCreation: true, applyAtShellIntegration: true });
```

### Share Provider

The [Share API proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4137aa15f55c5ec3777daf6684908f64b439f6aa/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.shareProvider.d.ts) allows extensions to provide ways to share resources in VS Code.

Share provider results are currently surfaced as a top-level `Share...` command palette action and as a new icon near the command center, provided you have opted in with `"workbench.experimental.share.enabled": true` and `"window.commandCenter": true`:

<video src="images/1_79/share-provider.mp4" controls title="Share... icon next to the command center"></video>

Please leave feedback on the [API proposal issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/176316).

### Static Status Bar Items

Status bar items can now be contributed statically via `package.json#contributes/statusBarItems`. With this an extension can delay their activation further and only activate when the status bar item is interacted with, e.g on the command. Once activated, extensions can pick up their static status bar items via the `vscode.window.createStatusBarItem`-API

### `workspace.save` and `workspace.saveAs`

The [Save Editor API proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/d823366750a14132c71ab9eea0696ea2bb64144f/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.saveEditor.d.ts) allows extensions to trigger the flow of saving an editor either to its resource or by asking the user to provide a resource.

All the methods for saving will return the resulting `Uri` or `undefined` if the operation was cancelled. Untitled files will always ask the user for a destination unless a path is already associated.

### Authentication `authGetSessions` proposed API

As we move closer to having [Multiple GitHub account support](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/127967), we have a new proposed API for authentication that provides the ability to get all sessions that your extension has access to for a specific set of scopes. [The proposal for these API additions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.authGetSessions.d.ts) has several things to call out:

* The introduction of `vscode.authentication.getSessions` that would allow to get sessions for each account that your extension has access to (if you want to request an additional account, use `{ createIfNone: true, clearSessionPreference: true }` to ask the user to choose an account).
* The `forceNewSession` property now can take in a `{ sessionToRecreate: session }` object that would allow consuming extensions to specify the exact session you want to be recreated
* The `createSession` function that an Auth Provider implements will now get passed in that session to recreate (using the extension's session preference if `true` is used for the value of `forceNewSession`)

There is still more work involved to make this ready for adoption in the GitHub Authentication extension so if you're interested, please follow along and feel free to [provide feedback in the issue that tracks this proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/152399).

## Engineering

### Milestone Automation

We have implemented automated milestone replication throughout all of our GitHub repositories. This means that the monthly milestones established in `microsoft/vscode` serve as the foundation for all other milestones that are created and maintained.

### Electron Sandbox enabled for all users

We are happy to announce that the Electron sandbox is rolling out to all of our users. This was a journey that started in early 2020 and now finally comes to an end. Please refer to the [blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/11/28/vscode-sandbox) that covers all the details.

### Extension host restart participation

Certain actions in the workbench can lead to the extension host restarting without reloading the window you are in. For example, when you switch profiles, we restart the extension host to account for running a different set of extensions for that profile.

Some custom and notebook editors however may not be functional anymore after having switched profiles because a required extension is not installed in that profile. If the editor has unsaved changes, it was hard to avoid data loss here. As a fix, components in VS Code can now participate in extension host restarts and make sure any unsaved changes are saved before the extension host restarts.
