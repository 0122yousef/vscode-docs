### Copilot

While using the `/fix` command, it is now possible to enable iterative fixing with the setting `github.copilot.editor.iterativeFixing`. When this setting is enabled, if after the first fix, there remain diagnostic errors in the selection, the fix is ran a second time. This setting is enabled by default.
