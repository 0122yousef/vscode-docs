Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.81 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22July+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Profiles

### Support for Partial Profiles

You can now create a profile in which you can customize only a subset of configurations (Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, Snippets, Tasks & Extensions). For example, you can create a Profile with all configurations except for Keyboard Shortcuts, and VS Code will apply the keyboard shortcuts from the Default Profile when this Profile is active. Following picture shows the UI for creating such a Profile.

![Create Profile](images/1_81/profiles_create.png)

You can also create a partial profile by copying from Profile Templates or from an existing Profile using the dropdown menu which is shown in the following picture.

![Create a Profile by copying](images/1_81/profiles_create_copy.png)

You can also configure an existing Profile to use configurations from the Default Profile by editing the Profile like shown in the following picture.

![Edit Profile](images/1_81/profile_edit.png)

When exporting such a profile you can choose to export only the configurations that are customized in the Profile or also includes the configurations from the Default Profile. The following picture shows the UI for exporting a Profile.

![Export Profile](images/1_81/profile_export.png)

### Apply a Setting to all Profiles

You can now apply a setting to all profiles by selecting the **Apply Setting to all Profiles** option in the Settings editor.

![Apply setting to all Profiles](images/1_81/profiles_apply_setting_all.png)

This will apply the value of the setting to all profiles. Any updates to this setting from any profile will be applied to all profiles. You can revert this by unchecking the **Apply Setting to all Profiles** option.

### Apply an Extension to all Profiles

You can now apply an extension to all profiles by selecting the **Apply Extension to all Profiles** option in the Extensions view.

![Apply an extension to all Profiles](images/1_81/profiles_apply_extension_all.png)

This will make this extension available in all profiles. Any updates to this extension from any profile will be applied to all profiles. You can revert this by unchecking the **Apply Extension to all Profiles** option.

### Settings JSON file command IDs adjusted on non-default profiles

The `workbench.action.openSettingsJson` command will now open the profile-specific settings JSON file when a user is in a non-default profile. To show application-scoped settings, use the `workbench.action.openApplicationSettingsJson` command instead.

## Editor

## Terminal

## Source Control

## Languages

## Notebooks

## VS Code for the Web

### Always load latest versions of built-in extensions

vscode.dev now always loads the latest versions of the built-in extensions. This means that you will no longer see the "Reload Required" notification for the built-in extensions to update them to the latest version when you open vscode.dev.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_81.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Inline Chat

While using the inline chat, you can now enable and disable the diff view using the setting `inlineChat.showDiff`. You can also spawn a context menu on right-click on the inline chat that allows to change this setting.

#### Iterative fixing

While using the `/fix` command, it is now possible to enable iterative fixing with the setting `github.copilot.editor.iterativeFixing`. When this setting is enabled, if after the first fix, there remain diagnostic errors in the selection, the fix is ran a second time. This setting is enabled by default.

#### Notebook generation improvements

While generating a notebook, we can now run extra steps to improve the quality of the generated code and also fix diagnostics detected in the generated code by language extensions. This is disabled by default, but can be enabled with follwing setting


```json
"github.copilot.notebook": {
  "iterativeFixing": true,
  "iterativeImproving": true
}
```

### Python

#### Npm package to access Extension API

The [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) now provides a npm package to make it easier for other extension authors to access and track changes in the Python extension API. Check out [@vscode/python-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/python-extension) npm module to work with Python environments available on the user's machine.

### Jupyter

#### Connect to Jupyter server on Codespace and Continue On with uncommitted changes

When working on Jupyter notebook on github.dev, you can now connect to Jupyter server running on a Codespace instance through the kernel picker.

<video src="images/1_81/connect-to-codespace.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Connect to Jupyter Server on Codespace"></video>

You can switch to the underling Codespace instance by clicking on the "Continue on" button in the notebook toolbar, and it will carry over any uncommitted changes in the workspace to the Codespace instance.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues.

Review the [changelog for the 0.69.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0690) release of the extension to learn about the other highlights.

## Preview Features

## Extension authoring

### revealSetting and focusSearch added to IOpenSettingsActionOptions

Extensions can now pass the `revealSetting` object and `focusSearch` boolean into commands such as `workbench.action.openSettingsJson` that accept `IOpenSettingsActionOptions` args.

For example, the following command

```ts
vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.openSettingsJson', { revealSetting: { key: 'editor.renderWhitespace' }});
```

opens the user settings JSON file, and then reveals the `editor.renderWhitespace` setting if it exists.

### Kerberos Authentication for Network Proxy

Extensions using the `https` Node.js module can now use network proxies that require Kerberos authentication. The local machine needs to have Kerberos configured, extensions do not need to do anything to use this feature.

In cases where the automatically selected service principal name does not work, the user can provide one in the user settings:

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.
