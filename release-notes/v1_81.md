# July 2023 (version 1.81)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.81 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22July+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

>If you'd like to read release notes for previous VS Code versions, go to [Updates](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) on [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Accessibility

### Accessible View improvements

The **Open Accessible View** (`kb(editor.action.accessibleView)`) command allows screen reader users to inspect content character by character, line by line. Last iteration, we added support for this in editor hovers and chat panel responses.

There are now accessible views for notifications, inline chat responses, Jupyter notebook output and workbench hovers.

When an element that offers an accessible view is focused, a hint is provided in the ARIA label. That hint can be disabled per feature via the `accessibility.verbosity` setting.

There are **Show Next in Accessible View** (`kb(editor.action.accessibleViewNext)`) and **Show Previous in Accessible View** (`kb(editor.action.accessibleViewPrevious)`) commands for easy navigation between elements in the chat panel and notifications list.

### Breadcrumb symbol information

After using the **Focus and Select Breadcrumbs** (`breadcrumbs.focusAndSelect`) command, the [breadcrumb](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_breadcrumbs) navigation now includes symbol information for those using screen readers.

### Input control and result navigation consistency

The experience when navigating between an input control (for example, search or filter input) and its results is now consistent across the Extensions view, the Keyboard Shortcuts editor, and the Comments, Problems, and Debug Console panels using (`kb(widgetNavigation.focusNext)`) and (`kb(widgetNavigation.focusPrevious)`).

## Workbench

### Release notes for upcoming update

Whenever a monthly stable update is ready to be installed, you can now preview the release notes via the **Show Update Release Notes** command in the **Manage** menu (gear button) at the bottom of the Activity bar.

## Profiles

### Support for partial profiles

You can now create a profile in which you can customize only a subset of configurations (Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, Snippets, Tasks & Extensions). For example, you can create a Profile with all configurations except for Keyboard Shortcuts, and VS Code applies the keyboard shortcuts from the Default Profile when this Profile is active. Following picture shows the UI for creating such a Profile.

![Create Profile](images/1_81/profiles_create.png)

You can also create a partial profile by copying from Profile Templates or from an existing Profile using the dropdown menu shown in the following picture.

![Create a Profile by copying](images/1_81/profiles_create_copy.png)

You can also configure an existing Profile to use configurations from the Default Profile by editing the Profile like shown in the following picture.

![Edit Profile](images/1_81/profile_edit.png)

When exporting such a profile, you can choose to export only the configurations that are customized in the Profile or also includes the configurations from the Default Profile. The following picture shows the UI for exporting a Profile.

![Export Profile](images/1_81/profile_export.png)

### Apply a setting to all profiles

You can now apply a setting to all profiles by selecting the **Apply Setting to all Profiles** option in the Settings editor.

![Apply setting to all profiles](images/1_81/profiles_apply_setting_all.png)

This will apply the value of the setting to all profiles. Any updates to this setting from any profile will be applied to all profiles. You can revert this by unchecking the **Apply Setting to all Profiles** option.

### Apply an extension to all profiles

You can now apply an extension to all profiles by selecting the **Apply Extension to all Profiles** option in the Extensions view.

![Apply an extension to all Profiles](images/1_81/profiles_apply_extension_all.png)

This will make this extension available in all profiles. Any updates to this extension from any profile will be applied to all profiles. You can revert this by unchecking the **Apply Extension to all Profiles** option.

### Settings JSON file command IDs adjusted on non-default profiles

The `workbench.action.openSettingsJson` command will now open the profile-specific settings JSON file when a user is in a non-default profile. To show application-scoped settings, use the `workbench.action.openApplicationSettingsJson` command instead.

## Editor

## Terminal

## Source Control

### Support Git Repositories that have Symbolic Links on their Path

Based on community feedback we have added support for Git repositories that have symbolic links on their path by leveraging the `--path-format` option that was added to the `rev-parse` git command in version `2.31`. Starting with this release all source control functionality (ex: "Source Control" view, repository detection, added/modified/deleted lines editor decorations, etc.) should work as expected when opening such a repository.

## Testing

## Languages

## Notebooks

### Closed notebook rich content search

In a previous release, we introduced rich content workspace search for open notebooks. There is now preview support to also see rich content results for closed notebooks.

When you search for text in the Search view, the result previews from notebooks should match how the string looks when you open the notebook editor. Note that this will only show results for inputs when a notebook is closed. To try this, enable `search.experimental.closedNotebookRichContentResults` in your settings.

<video src="images/1_81/closed-notebook-search.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Closed notebook rich content search"></video>

### Improved performance for large streaming outputs

We have made performance improvements for large cell outputs that are streamed during execution. This reduces the amount of rendering activity but currently only applies to scrollable cell outputs.

## VS Code for the Web

### Always load latest versions of built-in extensions

[vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) now always loads the latest versions of the built-in extensions. This means that you will no longer see the "Reload Required" notification to update built-in extensions to the latest version when you open vscode.dev.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_81.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Inline Chat

While using the inline chat, you can now enable and disable the diff view using the setting `inlineChat.showDiff`. You can also spawn a context menu on right-click on the inline chat that allows to change this setting.

#### Iterative fixing

While using the `/fix` command, it is now possible to enable iterative fixing with the setting `github.copilot.editor.iterativeFixing`. When this setting is enabled, if after the first fix, there remain diagnostic errors in the selection, the fix is run a second time. This setting is enabled by default.

#### Notebook generation improvements

While generating a notebook, there are extra steps to improve the quality of the generated code and also fix diagnostics detected in the generated code by language extensions. This is disabled by default, but can be enabled with following setting

```json
"github.copilot.notebook": {
  "iterativeFixing": true,
  "iterativeImproving": true
}
```

<video src="images/1_81/notebook-cell-generation-fix-diagnostic.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Iterative fixing for notebook"></video>

#### Quick Chat UX improvments

The quick question experience has been revamped this iteration.

<video src="images/1_81/inputontop.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Quick Chat UX improvments"></video>

Like previously, you can toggle this view with `kb(chat.action.askQuickQuestion)`. Specific improvements include:

* **Conversational chat**: The quick question experience has been revamped to allow you to see your full conversation while still keeping the last question & answer in focus
* **Slash command completion**: You now see a completion widget when you type `/`

Additionally, we have introduced an experimental setting, called `chat.experimental.defaultMode`, that allows you to control what parts of chat are shown. It has 3 options:

* `chatView`: the default, that shows the Chat icon in the activity bar and launches the chat in the chat view
* `quickQuestion`: shows the Chat icon in the title bar that launches the quick question chat which clicked
* `both`: both icons are visible which show their respective experiences

We want to know any and all thoughts you have on this and the quick question experience in general! Please don't hesitate to open issues with feedback.

### Python

#### npm package for the Python extension API

The [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension now provides an npm package to make it easier for other extension authors to access and track changes in the Python extension API. Check out the [@vscode/python-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/python-extension) npm module to work with Python environments available on the user's machine.

#### Error tolerant pytest discovery

As part of the rollout of our new testing architecture, the Test Explorer panel now supports error-tolerant [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) discovery. When an error is thrown by pytest during discovery that can be handled, for example, an error from an unknown import, all other tests will still be discovered outside of the file with the error. This feature is only available on the new testing rewrite, which is still experimental. The rewrite is currently active for 100% of Insiders and 25% of Stable users but will be universally adopted shortly. In the meantime, you can opt in or out with the `pythonTestAdapter` setting.

#### Dev Container for the Python Extension

There is now a Dev Container for the Python extension with a Microsoft official node image. With this customized dev container, with pre-builds turned on, users will be able to open the Python extension repository in Codespaces, and start working on developing and testing the Python extension instantly, with no installation required. Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 are pre-installed so users can readily switch between Python versions using pyenv. 

### Jupyter

#### Connect to Jupyter server on Codespace and Continue On with uncommitted changes

When working on Jupyter notebook on [github.dev](https://github.dev), you can now connect to a Jupyter server running on a GitHub Codespace instance through the kernel picker.

<video src="images/1_81/connect-to-codespace.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Connect to Jupyter Server on GitHub Codespaces"></video>

You can switch to the underlying codespace by selecting the **Continue On** button in the notebook toolbar, and any uncommitted changes in the workspace are brought to the codespace.

<video src="images/1_81/continue-on-codespace.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Continue on Codespace"></video>

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. This iteration, we focused on updating the **Create** view to make it cleaner and more useful. Improvements to the **Create** view include:

* The view tries to detect the best possible base branch for your PR instead of always using the default branch.
* You can add reviewers, assignees, labels, and milestones to your PR from the **Create** view.
* By default, your last "create option" will be remembered (for example, draft or auto merge).
* The view performance is much faster.
* You can view diffs before publishing your branch.
* Once the branch is published, you can also view commits (this is coming soon for unpublished branches).

![New Create view](images/1_81/new-create-view.png)

Review the [changelog for the 0.70.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0700) release of the extension to learn about the other highlights.

### GitHub Authentication

### Revoking GitHub OAuth tokens on sign out

Previously, when you sign out of a GitHub account in VS Code, it would only remove OAuth tokens from the secrets storage. The token is still valid and able to make requests to GitHub's APIs. To improve the security of token management, we now attempt to [delete the token on the backend](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/apps/oauth-applications?apiVersion=2022-11-28#delete-an-app-token) making the token no longer valid after sign out.

## Preview Features

## Markdown smartly format pasted URLs as Markdown links

The `markdown.editor.pasteUrlAsFormattedLink` setting now has a new option of 'smart.' The smarter feature can now detect when you are in spaces where you may not want automatic markdown link pasting to occur.

This includes pasting within a markdown link, over another markdown link, within a code block, etc.

## Extension authoring

### revealSetting and focusSearch added to IOpenSettingsActionOptions

Extensions can now pass the `revealSetting` object and `focusSearch` boolean into commands such as `workbench.action.openSettingsJson` that accept `IOpenSettingsActionOptions` args.

For example, the following command

```ts
vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.openSettingsJson', { revealSetting: { key: 'editor.renderWhitespace' }});
```

opens the user settings JSON file, and then reveals the `editor.renderWhitespace` setting if it exists.

### Kerberos authentication for network proxy

Extensions using the `https` Node.js module can now use network proxies that require Kerberos authentication. The local machine needs to have Kerberos configured but extensions do not need to do anything to use this feature.

In cases where the automatically selected service principal name does not work, the user can provide one with the `http.proxyKerberosServicePrincipal` setting:

![Kerberos Service Principal setting](images/1_81/proxy-kerboros-service-principal.png)

### Icons in QuickPickItem finalized

The API for icons in `QuickPickItem` has been finalized. You can now use the `iconPath` property to display icons in `QuickPickItem`s.

![A quick pick with GitHub avatars as the item icons](images/1_81/icons-in-quick-pick.png)

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.
