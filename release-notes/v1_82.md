## Editor


### Sticky Scroll

This iterations there have been several improvements made to sticky scroll.
- Now by default sticky scroll is scrolled sideways when the editor horizontal scrollbar is scrolled. This feature can be turned off by disabling `editor.stickyScroll.scrollWithEditor`.
- It is possible to view the last line of a scope by holding the `shift` key and hovering over the sticky line. Clicking on a sticky line while holding `shift` will move the cursor to the last line of the scope.
- Folding icons have been added to the sticky scroll gutter. The rendering of these icons follows the setting `editor.showFoldingControls` which controls the rendering of the folding icons in the editor gutter.

### JSON

It is now possible to sort JSON or JSONC files on save. Use the setting `json.sortOnSave.enable` to enable this feature.


## Extension authoring


### Support for batch range formatting

The `DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider` API now supports batch formatting. This means it can optionally signal to the editor that is supports to be called with multiple ranges at once. This helps reducing the number of calls to the provider and thus improves performance.

To opt-in to batch formatting, providers must implement a new optional function: [`provideDocumentRangesFormattingEdits`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e34a26097d763548bf220da77b74922765c12fa2/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L4172)
