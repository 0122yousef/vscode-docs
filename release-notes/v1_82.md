## Accessibility

### Focused view in window title

The `window.title` setting now has a `${focusedView}` variable that displays the name of the view in the title bar, if a view is currently focused.

### Accessible View for inline completions

Inline completions, like those coming from the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) extension, for example, can now be inspected in the Accessible View.

### Improved navigation consistency across the workbench

Last iteration, we made the experience when navigating between an input control (for example, search or filter input) and its results consistent across components like the Extensions view, the Keyboard Shortcuts editor, and more using `kb(widgetNavigation.focusNext)` and `kb(widgetNavigation.focusPrevious)`. This has been extended to the Settings editor and GitHub Pull Request comment control.

This also works for navigating between the terminal and the terminal accessible buffer.

### Updated terminal accessible buffer keybindings

Previously, the terminal accessible buffer was opened via `Shift+Tab`. This conflicted with an existing action in some shells. As such, we've removed that keybinding in favor of `kb(widgetNavigation.focusNext)` and `kb(workbench.action.terminal.focusAccessibleBuffer)`, to align with the other Accessible Views.

### Actions in the Accessible View

Actions in the Accessible View allow screen reader users to go to `next/previous`, disable accessibility verbosity, and more for a given feature. These actions exist within a convenient toolbar on the view so that the current context can be preserved.

### Go to Symbol in the Accessible View

Accessibility help dialogs and some Accessible Views have a **Go to Symbol** (`kb(editor.action.accessibleViewGoToSymbol)`) action to allow for swifter navigation through content.

### Terminal focus after run setting

The terminal now has a `terminal.integrated.focusAfterRun` setting so that users can specify if the terminal, accessible buffer, or nothing should be focused when **Terminal: Run Selected Text In Active Terminal** is invoked.

## Workbench

### Built-in port forwarding

VS Code now has a built-in port forwarding system. This feature allows you to share locally-running services over the internet to other people and devices. To use it, select the **Forward a Port** button in the **Ports** view.

![Forward a Port button displayed in the Ports view](images/1_82/ports-view.png)

_Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/connor4312.codesong))_

Read more about port forwarding in the [Port Forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/port-forwarding) user guide.

### Command Center now on by default

The Command Center was introduced several months ago as a quick way to both discover and interact with VS Code. You can use it as a launch pad for finding what you're looking for like running a command in the Command Palette, running a task, and other quick experiences. We've been running an experiment enabling the Command Center by default and have gotten positive feedback, so we felt it was time to enable it by default.

Here is a video using the Command Center, and the back and forward buttons as well.

<video src="images/1_82/commandcenter.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Command Center"></video>

We see immense potential in the Command Center as being the center for finding anything in VS Code, so watch for more improvements in the future!

> **NOTE**: If you would rather not have the Command Center visible, you can right-click on it and uncheck the entry in the dropdown to hide it.

### Control how pinned editors close from keyboard or mouse

A new setting `workbench.editor.preventPinnedEditorClose` was added to give more control about how pinned tabs respond to keyboard shortcuts or mouse middle-click for closing an editor. By default, a pinned tab will not close from keyboard or mouse interactions. You can change this setting accordingly:

* `keyboardAndMouse`: a pinned tab will not close from keyboard shortcut or mouse middle-click (default since `1.82.x`)
* `keyboard`: a pinned tab will not close via keyboard shortcut (default until `1.81.x`)
* `mouse`: a pinned tab will not close via mouse middle-click
* `never`: a pinned tab will always close from keyboard shortcut or mouse middle-click

### New and updated themable colors for the Status bar

The Status bar already provides a lot of themable colors for its items. We now added more colors to this set to allow for theming hover foreground and background colors:

* `statusBarItem.errorHoverBackground`
* `statusBarItem.errorHoverForeground`
* `statusBarItem.warningHoverBackground`
* `statusBarItem.warningHoverForeground`
* `statusBarItem.remoteHoverBackground`
* `statusBarItem.remoteHoverForeground`
* `statusBarItem.offlineHoverBackground`
* `statusBarItem.offlineHoverForeground`

The following two color names were updated because the color no longer applies to the entire Status bar, but only to the remote indicator:

* `statusBar.offlineBackground` renamed to `statusBarItem.offlineBackground`
* `statusBar.offlineForeground` renamed to `statusBarItem.offlineForeground`

## Editor

### Sticky Scroll

This iteration there have been several improvements to the Sticky Scroll UI, available at the top of the editor (**View: Toggle Sticky Scroll**).

* Now by default Sticky Scroll is scrolled sideways when the editor horizontal scrollbar is scrolled. This feature can be turned off by disabling `editor.stickyScroll.scrollWithEditor`.
* It is possible to view the last line of a scope by holding the `Shift` key and hovering over the sticky line. Clicking on a sticky line while holding `Shift` moves the cursor to the last line of the scope.
* Folding icons have been added to the Sticky Scroll gutter. The rendering of these icons follows the setting `editor.showFoldingControls` that controls the rendering of the folding icons in the editor gutter.

### Sort JSON on save

It is now possible to sort JSON or JSONC (JSON with comments) files on save. Use the setting `json.sortOnSave.enable` to enable this feature.

### Settings editor natural language search with GitHub Copilot Chat

The Settings editor now allows natural language search with extensions such as GitHub Copilot Chat that implement the [RelatedInformation](#addition-of-relatedinformation-and-removal-of-semanticsimilarity) API.

The natural language search results are currently placed below keyword-matching results and ordered by descending similarity score, but we plan to fix the ordering next month so that the search results continue to be arranged by their table of contents group.

Natural language search currently relies on embeddings. Consequently, natural language search results will not show up in the Settings editor for searches made before the embeddings become available, that is a few seconds after the GitHub Copilot Chat extension activates.

![Searching "make text bigger" in the Settings editor shows editor.fontSize as a result](images/1_82/se-natural-language-search.png)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/mgwg.light-pink-theme))_

### Code Actions and Quick Fix navigation via keyboard

It is now possible to navigate quickly through the Quick Fix, Code Actions, or Source Control menus (the Action control) by typing any keyword or letter corresponding with available menu options. The filter utilizes fuzzy matching and searches are not limited to the first letter or prefix but includes the entire label text as well.

![Example of searching "Surround" or "Read" in the Refactor Menu](images/1_82/action-control-fuzzy-search.gif)

## Diff Editor

## Terminal

## Debug

### JavaScript Debugger

#### WebAssembly debugging

The JavaScript debugger will now automatically decompile WebAssembly modules to the WebAssembly Text Format, and allow you to step through and set breakpoints in the decompiled modules.

![Breakpoint hit during a WebAssembly debug session](images/1_82/js-debug-wat.png)

_Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/connor4312.codesong))_

#### Source map loading improvements

We made many improvements to the way source maps are loaded in this release:

* Source maps in some common cases, like in applications compiled with the `tsc` command line, are loaded 3-5x faster.
* Hot module reloading from the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) dev server is now supported.
* Source maps can now be automatically loaded from authenticated endpoints.

## Source Control

## Testing

### Improved status area

The 'status area' below the filter box in the Testing view is now more concise, and also provides a clickable action to rerun the most recently run tests. Holding `kbstyle(Alt)` while clicking on the button will debug those tests instead.

![Testing view status area displaying test result count, test timing, and rerun button](images/1_82/testing-status-area.png)

### Support for link detection in test output

Link detection now runs in the terminal where Test Output is shown. File names, paths, and URIs should now be clickable.

### Improved experience for test-correlated output

Test extensions can correlate console output with specific tests or locations. Previously, each output created in this way would appear as its own item in the Test Results view, and open in a text editor when selected.

Now, they are shown in a proper terminal, and navigating to an output message opens a terminal of that test's output with the message selected.

## Notebooks

### Copy cell output

The cell output menu now includes an option to copy the output to the system clipboard. The context menu can also be used for image output by right-clicking the image and selecting the **Copy** command.

<video src="images/1_82/copy-cell-output.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Copy Cell Output"></video>

## Languages

## VS Code for the Web

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_82.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Create workspaces from panel chat

You can now use `/createWorkspace` to create workspaces from a natural language description in the stable build of the [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension.

<!-- TODO@joyceerhl mp4 -->

We've also made the following improvements:

1. Proposed workspaces are now rendered as filetrees in the chat response.
2. You can click into files to open a readonly preview in the editor.
3. If Copilot's initial proposal wasn't quite right, you can ask follow-up questions to help Copilot iterate and improve.

#### Improvements to Quick Chat

We introduced Quick Chat a couple of months ago and have been iterating quickly to provide an experience that feels made for VS Code.

Highlights this iteration:

* More compact UX.
* Quick Chat now stays open when focus is lost.
* Sash and "scroll-to-grow" behavior to resize window.
* **Open Quick Chat** now in the Command Center.

![The Quick Chat window with a question and answer displayed](images/1_82/quickchat-with-answer.png)

Overall, the UX is more compact to align with other "Quick Open" experiences like the Command Palette (less padding everywhere, user and Copilot icons are smaller, buttons are inline instead of being in a title bar).

By default, when you ask a question, the Quick Chat resizes to focus on that question and answer to minimize screen real estate. We also think it helps focus on those quick questions that you might want to ask Copilot. The history of your conversation is still available and you can scroll up to go back in time.

Because of this dynamic height, we also wanted to provide a way to resize the window if you need more or less space. There are two options to adjust the window size. The first is what we call "scroll-to-grow." If your Quick Chat window is small from a small answer, but you'd like to see a previous long answer, as you scroll up, the Quick Chat grows to a max height.

<video src="images/1_82/quickchatscrolltogrow.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Quick Chat 'Scroll-to-Grow'"></video>

The height of the Quick Chat can be reset back to showing only the last question and answer by doing one of the following:

* Closing the Quick Chat and waiting 30 seconds.
* Asking another question or running `/clear` (keep in mind, `/clear` clears your chat history for good).
* Double-clicking on the bottom sash.

Speaking of the sash... we also have a sash at the bottom of the Quick Chat that can be used for manually adjusting the height of the Quick Chat. When you use the sash, you're opting out of the default dynamic behavior and are saying "I want this height to be fixed here until reset."

<video src="images/1_82/sashquickchat.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Quick Chat Sash"></video>

> **NOTE**: If you want to go back to the dynamic behavior, double-click the sash or type `/clear` in the chat (`/clear` clears your chat history).

Last but not least, you can launch Quick Chat from the Command Center with the **Open Quick Chat** option.

![Open Quick Chat in the Command Center](images/1_82/quickchat-commandcenter.png)

### Python

#### Terminal activation using environment variables

The [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension now has a new activation mechanism that activates the selected environment in the terminal without running any explicit activation commands. This month, we are beginning to roll this out as an experiment, making it the default experience. With the new approach, we use environment variables to activate terminals, which is done implicitly on terminal launch and thus can be much quicker especially for conda environments. You can add the following **User** setting: `"python.experiments.optInto": ["pythonTerminalEnvVarActivation"]` to try it out.

If you have any comments or suggestions regarding this experiment, feel free to share them in [vscode-python issue #11039](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/11039).

#### Recreate or use existing .venv environment

When working within a workspace that already contains a `.venv` folder, the **Python: Create Environment** command has been updated with options to either recreate or use the existing environment. If you decide to recreate the environment, your current `.venv` is deleted, allowing you to recreate a new environment named `.venv`. You can customize this new environment by following the **Python: Create Environment** flow to select your preferred interpreter and specify any dependency files for installation. In the case the environment cannot be deleted, for example, due to it being active, you are prompted to delete the environment manually.

Alternatively, if you choose to use the existing environment, the environment is selected for your workspace.

#### New Python Formatting article

There is a new dedicated topic on [Python Formatting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/formatting), where you'll learn how to set a default formatter such as [autopep8](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.autopep8) or [black](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter) and customize it through various settings.

### Jupyter

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues.

Review the [changelog for the 0.71.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0710) release of the extension to learn about the other highlights.

## Preview Features

### Quick Access text search

We are experimenting with showing workspace search results in a Quick Access menu. To try this, run **Search: Quick Text Search (Experimental)**. This command sets up the Quick Open to accept search queries. Type some text to see matches from different workspace files.

<video src="images/1_82/quick-search-demo.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Quick Search Demo"></video>

## Extension authoring

### Support for batch range formatting

The `DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider` API now supports batch formatting. This means that an extension can optionally signal to the editor that it supports being called with multiple ranges at once. This helps reduce the number of calls to the formatting provider and thus improves performance.

To opt in to batch formatting, providers must implement a new optional function: [provideDocumentRangesFormattingEdits](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e34a26097d763548bf220da77b74922765c12fa2/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L4172).

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### A contextValue on TestMessage's and contribution points

You can provide a `contextValue` on `TestMessage`s to be shown when users take actions on those messages. Additionally, two new menu contributions points are available, `testing/message/context` and `testing/message/content`. The former is displayed on the message in the Test Results tree view, and the latter is displayed over the message in the editor.

Read more about `contextValue` in [issue #190277](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/190277).

### Addition of RelatedInformation and removal of SemanticSimilarity

Several months ago, we introduced a `SemanticSimilarity` proposed API. The idea was that an extension like GitHub Copilot could implement this API to help VS Code compare arbitrary strings. VS Code used this in the Command Palette to allow GitHub Copilot to suggest similar commands based on what the user typed in.

While this approach worked, it wasn't quite the structure we wanted as it involved sending many strings back and forth from the Extension Host. This iteration, we have implemented a new proposed API called "Related Information." The goal of this API is to allow an extension to provide information that is relevant, given a query.

```ts

declare module 'vscode' {

    export enum RelatedInformationType {
        SymbolInformation = 1,
        CommandInformation = 2,
        SearchInformation = 3,
        SettingInformation = 4
    }

    interface RelatedInformationBaseResult {
        type: RelatedInformationType;
        weight: number;
    }

    // TODO: Symbols and Search

    export interface CommandInformationResult extends RelatedInformationBaseResult {
        type: RelatedInformationType.CommandInformation;
        command: string;
    }

    export interface SettingInformationResult extends RelatedInformationBaseResult {
        type: RelatedInformationType.SettingInformation;
        setting: string;
    }

    export type RelatedInformationResult = CommandInformationResult | SettingInformationResult;

    export interface RelatedInformationProvider {
        provideRelatedInformation(query: string, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<RelatedInformationResult[]>;
    }

    export namespace ai {
        export function getRelatedInformation(query: string, types: RelatedInformationType[], token: CancellationToken): Thenable<RelatedInformationResult[]>;
        export function registerRelatedInformationProvider(type: RelatedInformationType, provider: RelatedInformationProvider): Disposable;
    }
}
```

The code block above comes from [vscode.proposed.aiRelatedInformation.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/2d502be79d044ed34fcea16eeb02cf98b789789c/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.aiRelatedInformation.d.ts).

You can see that initially we have implemented this for commands, in the Command Palette, and settings, in the Settings editor. We plan on expanding the API to include smart results for symbols search and file text search.

## Engineering

### Exploration of voice to text integrations

During this milestone we explored how to provide voice-to-text capabilities in VS Code.

The first integration is planned for our various chat user interfaces as part of [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat). Natural language input is a great fit for the new voice-to-text service because it works best with natural language.

![Voice to text integration](images/1_82/voice-to-text.gif)

We are able to benefit from all the rich capabilities the browser provides to us for processing audio input from the microphone. And we can leverage our [MessagePort](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MessagePort) based architecture for the audio transcription:

* An [AudioWorklet](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet) captures raw uncompressed audio from the microphone in a separate thread.
* The data is sent to our shared process via direct [MessagePort](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MessagePort) communication.
* A native Node.js module converts the audio to text.
* The text is sent back to the UI.

![Voice to text diagram](images/1_82/voice-to-text.png)

This new capability is not yet ready for users to try out, but we plan to provide some early access over the coming months. We will then also share more details about the underlying Node.js module for the actual voice-to-text transcription service.
